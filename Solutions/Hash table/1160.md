# 1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-words-that-can-be-formed-by-characters/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100
words[i] and chars consist of lowercase English letters.
```

                --tmp[word[i]];
                if(tmp[word[i]] < 0)
                    break;
            }
            if(i == word.length()) // A good string is found
                goodStrLength += word.length();
        }
        return goodStrLength;
    }
};
