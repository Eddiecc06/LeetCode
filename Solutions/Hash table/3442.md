# 3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-even-and-odd-frequency-i/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2) between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:

  - a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
  - a2 has an even frequency in the string.

Return this maximum difference.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "aaaaabbc"

Output: 3

Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "abcabcab"

Output: 1

Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.
```

**Constraints**
```
3 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
s contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.
```
