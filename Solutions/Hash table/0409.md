# 409. Longest Palindrome
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/description/


## Problem Description

Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 2000
s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.
```

public:
    int longestPalindrome(string s) {
        //OddNumber : the number of character apears odd times
        int n = s.length(), OddNumber = 0;
        unordered_map<char, int> hashTable;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i){
            ++hashTable[s[i]];
            if(hashTable[s[i]] % 2 == 0)
                --OddNumber;
            else
                ++OddNumber;
        }
        if(OddNumber > 1) // for a valid Palindrome, only at most one character can appear odd times
            return n - OddNumber + 1; 
        else
            return n;
    }
};
