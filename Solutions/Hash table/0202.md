# 202. Happy Number
https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/description/

## Problem Description

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.

Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.

Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
```
