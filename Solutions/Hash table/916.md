# 916. Word Subsets
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-subsets/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.

A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.

  - For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".

A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.

Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["lc","eo"]
Output: ["leetcode"]
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: words1 = ["acaac","cccbb","aacbb","caacc","bcbbb"], words2 = ["c","cc","b"]
Output: ["cccbb"]
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 10^4
1 <= words1[i].length, words2[i].length <= 10
words1[i] and words2[i] consist only of lowercase English letters.
All the strings of words1 are unique.
```

        vector<int> counts(26, 0), tmp(26, 0);
        vector<string> ans;
        for(string &word2 : words2){

                if(counts[i] > tmp[i])
                    break;
            }
            //If the occurence of all characters in word1 is larger than / equal to count[i], then this word1 is universal
            if(i == 26)
                ans.push_back(word1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    vector<int> counter(string &word){
        vector<int> cnt(26, 0);
        for(auto &w : word)
            ++cnt[w - 'a'];
        return cnt;
    }
