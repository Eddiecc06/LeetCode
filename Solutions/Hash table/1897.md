#1897. Redistribute Characters to Make All Strings Equal
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/redistribute-characters-to-make-all-strings-equal/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings words (0-indexed).

In one operation, pick two distinct indices i and j, where words[i] is a non-empty string, and move any character from words[i] to any position in words[j].

Return true if you can make every string in words equal using any number of operations, and false otherwise.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
Output: true
Explanation: Move the first 'a' in words[1] to the front of words[2],
to make words[1] = "abc" and words[2] = "abc".
All the strings are now equal to "abc", so return true.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: words = ["ab","a"]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make all the strings equal using the operation.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 100
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
```

        for(auto word : words){
            for(char w : word)
                ++counts[w];
        }
        for(auto c : counts){
            if(c.second % n != 0) //It's impossible to make all words contain the same number of character 'c'
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
