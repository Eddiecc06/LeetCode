# 997. Find the Town Judge
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/description/)

## Problem Description

In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

  1. The town judge trusts nobody.
  2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
  3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 1000
0 <= trust.length <= 10^4
trust[i].length == 2
All the pairs of trust are unique.
ai != bi
1 <= ai, bi <= n
```

            if(TrustCounts[i] == n - 1 && TrustOther[i] == false)
                return i+1;
        }
        return -1;
