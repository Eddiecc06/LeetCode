# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/

## Problem Description

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```


**Constraints**
```
0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
```

### _C++ Code_
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        //dictionary : record the number hasn't been checked
        unordered_set<int> table(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i){
            //The nums[i] has been checked, ignore it
            if(!table.count(nums[i]))
                continue;
            //nums[i] will be checked, erase from the dictionary to avoid checking repeatedly.
            table.erase(nums[i]);
            int prev = nums[i] - 1, next = nums[i] + 1;
            //Check if there's existed consecutive number
            while(table.count(prev))
                table.erase(prev--);
            while(table.count(next))
                table.erase(next++);
            ans = max(ans, next - prev - 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
