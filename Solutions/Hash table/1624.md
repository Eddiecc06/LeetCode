# 1624. Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-substring-between-two-equal-characters/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters. If there is no such substring return -1.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "aa"
Output: 0
Explanation: The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two 'a's.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "abca"
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal substring here is "bc".
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "cbzxy"
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no characters that appear twice in s.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 300
s contains only lowercase English letters.
```
