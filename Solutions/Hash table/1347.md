# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.

Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.

An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
Output: 5
Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
Output: 0
Explanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams. 
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
s.length == t.length
s and t consist of lowercase English letters only.
```

class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(string s, string t) {
        //s_count[i] : The counts of character ('a' + i) of the string s
        //t_count[i] : The counts of character ('a' + i) of the string t
        vector<int> s_count(26, 0), t_count(26, 0);
        int steps = 0;
        for(char c : s)
            ++s_count[c - 'a'];
        for(char c : t)
            ++t_count[c - 'a'];
        for(int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
            steps += abs(s_count[i] - t_count[i]);
        return steps / 2;
    }
};
