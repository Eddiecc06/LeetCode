# 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary 
https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/description/

## Problem Description

In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. 

The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, 

return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.



**Example 1**:
```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 20
order.length == 26
All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.
```

            //The second string is matched to the first substirng while the second string is shorter.
            if(m > n && word1.substr(0, n) == word2)
                return false;
        }
