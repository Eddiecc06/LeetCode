#  438. Find All Anagrams in a String
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/description/

## Problem Description

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```


**Constraints**
```
Constraints:

1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104
s and p consist of lowercase English letters.
```

        //hash_table : record the times of each character of p
        vector<int> ans, hash_table(26, 0);
        //sliding window : left pointer and right pointer
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int wordCnt = p.size();
        for(auto &c : p)
            ++hash_table[c - 'a'];
        for(right = 0; right < s.size(); ++right){
            //sliding window length becomes larger than string p, move left pointer.
            if(right - left == p.size() ){
                //if the left poitner indicated to the character of string p, we need to add the count +1 since the left poitner is moved
                if(hash_table[s[left] - 'a']++ >= 0)
                    ++wordCnt;
                ++left;
            }
            //find the character of string p
            if(hash_table[s[right] - 'a']-- >= 1)
                --wordCnt;
            //find an anagram, return th left slide of sliding window
            if(wordCnt == 0)
                ans.push_back(left);
            
        }
        return ans;
