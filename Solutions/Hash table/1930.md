# 1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-the-array-from-adjacent-pairs/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "adc"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "bbcbaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
```

**Constraints**
```
3 <= s.length <= 10^5
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
```
