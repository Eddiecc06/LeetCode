# 974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K

https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/description/

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by k.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], k = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by k = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]
```

### The idea of solving the probelm
    From Modular arithmetic, if we can get the same remainder from two (cumulative sums % k), then we could get a subarray having a sum divisible by k from these two cumulative sums
    If (cumulative sums % k) is a negative value, we must add K to get a correct remainder.
    Take [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], k = 5 for example :
    [4] -> (cumulative sums % k) = 4; 
    [4, 5] -> (cumulative sums % k) = 4; We can get a subarray having a sum divisible by k from [4] & [4, 5].
                                         i.e. [5]
    [4, 5, 0] -> (cumulative sums % k) = 4; We can get a subarray from [4] & [4, 5] & [4, 5, 0]. 
                                            i.e. [5,0] , [0]
    [4, 5, 0, -2] -> (cumulative sums % k) = 2;
    [4, 5, 0, -2, -3] -> (cumulative sums % k) = 4; We can get a subarray from [4] & [4, 5] & [4, 5, 0] & [4,5,0,-2,-3]. 
                                                    i.e. [5,-2,-3], [5,0,-2,-3], [0,-2,-3]
    [4,5,0,-2,-3,1] -> (cumulative sums % k) = 0; [4,5,0,-2,-3,1] is a subarrays having a sum divisible by k.
    Therefore, ans = 7
### _C++ Code_
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDivByK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int ans  = 0, sum = 0, remain;
        unordered_map<int, int> hash_table;  //Record the array has the same remaining number.
        hash_table[0] = 1; //Initialize the case of remainder = 0. If remainder is 0, it means that the sume of this subarray is divisible by k
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            sum += nums[i];
            remain = sum % k;
            if(remain < 0) 
                remain += k;
            if(hash_table.find(remain) != hash_table.end())
                ans += hash_table[remain];
            ++hash_table[remain];
            cout<<ans<<endl;
        }
        return ans;

    }
};
