# 1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-09-12

## Problem Description

A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.

Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.

The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string.

For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.

 
**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already good.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "ceabaacb"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s contains only lowercase English letters.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletions(string s) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0); // Record the frequency of a character
        unordered_set<int> usedFreq; // Record the unique frequency
        int deletions = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i){
            ++freq[s[i] - 'a'];
        }
        for(int f : freq){
            while(f > 0 && usedFreq.find(f) != usedFreq.end()){
                --f; // Not an unique frequency of current character. Delete it once time
                ++deletions;
            }
            usedFreq.insert(f); //Record the unique frequency
        }
        return deletions;
    }
};
