# 2716. Minimize String Length
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-string-length/description/

## Problem Description

Given a 0-indexed string s, repeatedly perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose an index i in the string, and let c be the character in position i. Delete the closest occurrence of c to the left of i (if any) and the closest occurrence of c to the right of i (if any).

Your task is to minimize the length of s by performing the above operation any number of times.

Return an integer denoting the length of the minimized string.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "aaabc"
Output: 3
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 3
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "dddaaa"
Output: 2
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 100
s contains only lowercase English letters
```
