# 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists/)

## Problem Description

Given two arrays of strings list1 and list2, find the common strings with the least index sum.

A common string is a string that appeared in both list1 and list2.

A common string with the least index sum is a common string such that if it appeared at list1[i] and list2[j] then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.

Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only common string is "Shogun".
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The common string with the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: list1 = ["happy","sad","good"], list2 = ["sad","happy","good"]
Output: ["sad","happy"]
Explanation: There are three common strings:
"happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
"sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
"good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000
1 <= list1[i].length, list2[i].length <= 30
list1[i] and list2[i] consist of spaces ' ' and English letters.
All the strings of list1 are unique.
All the strings of list2 are unique.
There is at least a common string between list1 and list2.
```
