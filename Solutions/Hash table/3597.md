# 3597. Partition String
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-string/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a string s, partition it into unique segments according to the following procedure:

  - Start building a segment beginning at index 0.
  - Continue extending the current segment character by character until the current segment has not been seen before.
  - Once the segment is unique, add it to your list of segments, mark it as seen, and begin a new segment from the next index.
  - Repeat until you reach the end of s.

Return an array of strings segments, where segments[i] is the ith segment created.




**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "abbccccd"

Output: ["a","b","bc","c","cc","d"]
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "aaaa"

Output: ["a","aa"]
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s contains only lowercase English letters.
```

        string cur = "";
        while(i < n){
            cur += s[i];
