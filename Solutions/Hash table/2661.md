# 2661. First Completely Painted Row or Column
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-completely-painted-row-or-column/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a 0-indexed integer array arr, and an m x n integer matrix mat. arr and mat both contain all the integers in the range [1, m * n].

Go through each index i in arr starting from index 0 and paint the cell in mat containing the integer arr[i].

Return the smallest index i at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in mat.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: arr = [1,3,4,2], mat = [[1,4],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The moves are shown in order, and both the first row and second column of the matrix become fully painted at arr[2].
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: arr = [2,8,7,4,1,3,5,6,9], mat = [[3,2,5],[1,4,6],[8,7,9]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The second column becomes fully painted at arr[3].
```

**Constraints**
```
m == mat.length
n = mat[i].length
arr.length == m * n
1 <= m, n <= 105
1 <= m * n <= 105
1 <= arr[i], mat[r][c] <= m * n
All the integers of arr are unique.
All the integers of mat are unique.
```

            //Either a row or a column is completely painted
            if(RowCnt[r] == 0 || ColCnt[c] == 0)
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
