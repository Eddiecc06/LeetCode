# 731. My Calendar II
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-ii/description/)

## Problem Description

You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.

A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendarTwo class:

  - MyCalendarTwo() Initializes the calendar object.
  - boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.


**Example 1**:
```
Input
["MyCalendarTwo", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [50, 60], [10, 40], [5, 15], [5, 10], [25, 55]]
Output
[null, true, true, true, false, true, true]

Explanation
MyCalendarTwo myCalendarTwo = new MyCalendarTwo();
myCalendarTwo.book(10, 20); // return True, The event can be booked. 
myCalendarTwo.book(50, 60); // return True, The event can be booked. 
myCalendarTwo.book(10, 40); // return True, The event can be double booked. 
myCalendarTwo.book(5, 15);  // return False, The event cannot be booked, because it would result in a triple booking.
myCalendarTwo.book(5, 10); // return True, The event can be booked, as it does not use time 10 which is already double booked.
myCalendarTwo.book(25, 55); // return True, The event can be booked, as the time in [25, 40) will be double booked with the third event, the time [40, 50) will be single booked, and the time [50, 55) will be double booked with the second event.
```

**Constraints**
```
0 <= start < end <= 10^9
At most 1000 calls will be made to book.
```

public:
    MyCalendarTwo(){

    }
    bool book(int start, int end) {
        //Check if it's a triple booking. Check if it's overlapping with any double booking date
        for(auto &[booked_start, booked_end] : double_bookings){
            // Triple booking
            if( max(start, booked_start) < min(end, booked_end))
                return false;

                double_bookings.push_back({max(start, booked_start), min(end, booked_end)});
        }
        // Add the event to single bookings
        single_bookings.push_back({start, end});
        return true;
    }
