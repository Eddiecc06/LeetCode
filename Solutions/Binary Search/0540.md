# 540. Single Element in a Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/description/

## Problem Description

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= nums[i] <= 105
```

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        //handling the case that only one element in the sorted array 
        if(nums.size()==1)
            return nums[0];
        int left = 0, right = nums.size(), mid;
        while(left < right){
            mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            //It means that the single element doesn't appear before the middle index.
            //The single element must locate at the right hand of middle index
            if((mid%2 == 0 && nums[mid] == nums[mid+1]) || (mid%2 == 1 && nums[mid] == nums[mid-1]))
                left = mid+1;
            else
                right = mid;
        }
        return nums[right];
    }
};
