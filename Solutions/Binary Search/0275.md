# 275. H-Index II
https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/description/

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in ascending order, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: citations = [1,2,100]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints**
```
n == citations.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
citations is sorted in ascending order.

```

        while(left <= right){
          mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
          //researcher has published  (n-mid) papers that have each been cited more than (n-mid) times.
          if(citations[mid] == n - mid)
            return n - mid;
          // "h" isn't the maximum value. Should search in the right side
          else if(citations[mid] < n - mid)
            left = mid + 1;
          //There are citations[mid] papers that have more than citations[mid] citations. Should search in the left side
          else
            right = mid - 1;
        }
        return n - left;
    }
};
