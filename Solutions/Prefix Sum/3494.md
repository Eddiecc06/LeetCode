# 3494. Find the Minimum Amount of Time to Brew Potions
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-amount-of-time-to-brew-potions/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.

In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].

Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. ​

Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.


**Example 1**:
```
Example 1:
Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]
Output: 110
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: skill = [1,1,1], mana = [1,1,1]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Preparation of the 0th potion begins at time t = 0, and is completed by time t = 3.
Preparation of the 1st potion begins at time t = 1, and is completed by time t = 4.
Preparation of the 2nd potion begins at time t = 2, and is completed by time t = 5.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: skill = [1,2,3,4], mana = [1,2]
Output: 21
```

**Constraints**
```
n == skill.length
m == mana.length
1 <= n, m <= 5000
1 <= mana[i], skill[i] <= 5000
```

class Solution {
public:
    long long minTime(vector<int>& skill, vector<int>& mana) {
        int n = skill.size(), m = mana.size();
        vector<long long> times(n, 0);
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j){
            //curTime : The minimum available time to brew potion with capacity mana[j]
            long long curTime = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
                curTime = max(curTime, times[i]) + skill[i]*mana[j];
            
            //Update time array to record the minimum available time to start brewing potion
            times[n - 1] = curTime;
            for(int k = n - 2; k >= 0; --k)
                times[k] = times[k + 1] - skill[k + 1]*mana[j];
        }
        return times[n - 1];
    }
};
