# 3152. Special Array II
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-ii/description/)

## Problem Description

An array is considered special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.

You are given an array of integer nums and a 2D integer matrix queries, where for queries[i] = [fromi, toi] your task is to check that 
subarray nums[fromi..toi] is special or not.

Return an array of booleans answer such that answer[i] is true if nums[fromi..toi] is special.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [3,4,1,2,6], queries = [[0,4]]
Output: [false]
Explanation:
The subarray is [3,4,1,2,6]. 2 and 6 are both even.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [4,3,1,6], queries = [[0,2],[2,3]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation:
The subarray is [4,3,1]. 3 and 1 are both odd. So the answer to this query is false.
The subarray is [1,6]. There is only one pair: (1,6) and it contains numbers with different parity. So the answer to this query is true.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
queries[i].length == 2
0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] <= nums.length - 1
```

        int n = nums.size(), m = queries.size();
        vector<int> special(n, 0);
        vector<bool> ans;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
            //If it's not satisfied the "special" condition, increase with 1
            if(nums[i-1] % 2 == nums[i] % 2)
                special[i] = special[i-1] + 1;
            else
            //It's satisfied the "special" condition
                special[i] = special[i-1];
        }

        for(const auto &q : queries)
            //If special[from] == special[to], it means that all elements in that subarray nums[fromi..toi] are satisfied with "special" condition 
            ans.push_back(special[q[0]] == special[q[1]]);
        return ans;        
    }
};
