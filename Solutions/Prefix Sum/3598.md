# 3598. Longest Common Prefix Between Adjacent Strings After Removals
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix-between-adjacent-strings-after-removals/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings words. For each index i in the range [0, words.length - 1], perform the following steps:

  - Remove the element at index i from the words array.
  - Compute the length of the longest common prefix among all adjacent pairs in the modified array.

Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between the adjacent pairs after removing the element at index i. If no adjacent pairs remain or if none share a common prefix, then answer[i] should be 0.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: words = ["jump","run","run","jump","run"]

Output: [3,0,0,3,3]

Explanation:

 - Removing index 0:
    words becomes ["run", "run", "jump", "run"]
    Longest adjacent pair is ["run", "run"] having a common prefix "run" (length 3)
 - Removing index 1:
    words becomes ["jump", "run", "jump", "run"]
    No adjacent pairs share a common prefix (length 0)
 - Removing index 2:
    words becomes ["jump", "run", "jump", "run"]
    No adjacent pairs share a common prefix (length 0)
 - Removing index 3:
    words becomes ["jump", "run", "run", "run"]
    Longest adjacent pair is ["run", "run"] having a common prefix "run" (length 3)
 - Removing index 4:
    words becomes ["jump", "run", "run", "jump"]
    Longest adjacent pair is ["run", "run"] having a common prefix "run" (length 3)
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: words = ["dog","racer","car"]

Output: [0,0,0]

Explanation:

Removing any index results in an answer of 0.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= words.length <= 10^5
1 <= words[i].length <= 10^4
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
The sum of words[i].length is smaller than or equal 10^5.
```

        vector<int> longestCommonPrefix(n - 1, 0);
        //maxPrefix
        vector<int> maxPrefix(n - 1), maxSuffix(n - 1);

        for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
            longestCommonPrefix[i] = FindPrefixLength(words[i], words[i + 1]);
        
        
        maxPrefix[0] = longestCommonPrefix[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++)
            maxPrefix[i] = max(maxPrefix[i - 1], longestCommonPrefix[i]);


        maxSuffix[n - 2] = longestCommonPrefix[n - 2];
        for(int i = n - 3; i >= 0; i--) {
            maxSuffix[i] = max(maxSuffix[i + 1], longestCommonPrefix[i]);
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(i > 1) //Remove index 'i', the maximum possible length of common prefix derived from words[0 ... i - 1]
                ans[i] = max(ans[i], maxPrefix[i-2]);
            if(i < n - 2) //Remove index 'i', the maximum possible length of common prefix derived from words[i + 1 ... n - 1]
                ans[i] = max(ans[i], maxSuffix[i+1]);
            if(i > 0 && i < n-1) // Remove index 'i', calculate the length of common prefix of words[i-1], words[i+1]
                ans[i] = max(ans[i],  FindPrefixLength(words[i-1], words[i+1]));
        }
        return ans;
    }
