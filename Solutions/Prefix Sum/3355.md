# 3355. Zero Array Transformation I
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/zero-array-transformation-i/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [li, ri].

For each queries[i]:

  - Select a subset of indices within the range [li, ri] in nums.
  - Decrement the values at the selected indices by 1.

A Zero Array is an array where all elements are equal to 0.

Return true if it is possible to transform nums into a Zero Array after processing all the queries sequentially, otherwise return false.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1], queries = [[0,2]]

Output: true

Explanation:

For i = 0:
Select the subset of indices as [0, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
The array will become [0, 0, 0], which is a Zero Array.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [4,3,2,1], queries = [[1,3],[0,2]]

Output: false

Explanation:

For i = 0:
Select the subset of indices as [1, 2, 3] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
The array will become [4, 2, 1, 0].
For i = 1:
Select the subset of indices as [0, 1, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
The array will become [3, 1, 0, 0], which is not a Zero Array.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
queries[i].length == 2
0 <= li <= ri < nums.length
```

        int decrease = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            decrease += Prefix[i];
            if(decrease < nums[i]) // It's impossible to make nums[i] be 0
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
