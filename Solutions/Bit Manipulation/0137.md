# 137. Single Number II
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/description/

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. 

Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
```

        int ans = 0, sum;
        //Calculate the total numbers of each bits. since the input is integer, need to check 32 bits
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; ++i){
            sum = 0;
            for(int j = 0; j < nums.size(); ++j)
                sum += (nums[j] >> i) & 1;
            
            ans |= (sum % 3) << i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
