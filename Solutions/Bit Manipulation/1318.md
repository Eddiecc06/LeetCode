# 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-flips-to-make-a-or-b-equal-to-c/


## Problem Description

Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation).

Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
Output: 1
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 0
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= a <= 10^9
1 <= b <= 10^9
1 <= c <= 10^9
```

                if(c & mask == 1)  //the case that a = 0 and b = 0, we need to flip one bit of a or b
                    flips += 1;
                else //the case that c = 0, we may flip bits of both a and b(a = 1 and b = 1) 
                    // or only one bit of a or b  (a = 1 and b = 0 / a = 0 and b = 1)
                    flips = flips + (a & mask) + (b & mask);
            }
            a >>= 1;
