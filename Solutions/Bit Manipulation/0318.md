# 318. Maximum Product of Word Lengths
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-word-lengths/description/

## Problem Description

Given a string array words, return the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) 

where the two words do not share common letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: words = ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
Output: 4
Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: 0
Explanation: No such pair of words.
```

**Constraints**
```
2 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
```

                mask[i] |= 1 << (c - 'a');
            //Find the word don't share common letters by checking bitmap of visited word
            for(int j = 0; j < i; ++j){
                if(!(mask[i] & mask[j]))
                    ans = max(ans, int(words[i].size() * words[j].size()) );
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
