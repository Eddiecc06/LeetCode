# 461. Hamming Distance
https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/description/

## Problem Description

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints**
```
0 <= x, y <= 2^31 - 1
```
