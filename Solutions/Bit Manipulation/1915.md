# 1915. Number of Wonderful Substrings
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-wonderful-substrings/description/)

## Problem Description

A wonderful string is a string where at most one letter appears an odd number of times.

  - For example, "ccjjc" and "abab" are wonderful, but "ab" is not.

Given a string word that consists of the first ten lowercase English letters ('a' through 'j'), return the number of wonderful non-empty substrings in word. If the same substring appears multiple times in word, then count each occurrence separately.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: word = "aba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The four wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "aba" -> "a"
- "aba" -> "b"
- "aba" -> "a"
- "aba" -> "aba"
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: word = "aabb"
Output: 9
Explanation: The nine wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "aabb" -> "a"
- "aabb" -> "aa"
- "aabb" -> "aab"
- "aabb" -> "aabb"
- "aabb" -> "a"
- "aabb" -> "abb"
- "aabb" -> "b"
- "aabb" -> "bb"
- "aabb" -> "b"
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: word = "he"
Output: 2
Explanation: The two wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "he" -> "h"
- "he" -> "e"
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= word.length <= 10^5
word consists of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'j'.
```

### _C++ Code_
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long wonderfulSubstrings(string word) {
        long long ans = 0;
        //bitmap : 0000000000. The left most bit represents 'j' and the right most bit represents 'a'
        //0000000001 : Means that only 'a' appears odd number of times
        //0000000100 : Means that only 'c' appears odd number of times
        //0000000101 : Means that both 'a' and 'c' appears odd number of times
        int counts[1024] = {1};
        int mask = 0;
        for(char &w : word){
            //XOR operation. Therefore, the bit will be 1 only when the character appears odd times
            mask ^= 1 << (w - 'a');
            ans += counts[mask];
            for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
                ans += counts[mask^(1 << i)];
            ++counts[mask];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
