# 191. Number of 1 Bits 
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/

## Problem Description

Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).


**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```
