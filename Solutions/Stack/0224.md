# 224. Basic Calculator
https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/description/


## Problem Description

Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5
s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
s represents a valid expression.
'+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
'-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
```

                num = num*10 + (c - '0');

                num = 0; //reset number
                sign = (c == '+') ? 1 : -1; //Update sign according to operation
            }
            //push current calculation result to stack first
            else if(c == '('){
                st.push(ans);
                st.push(sign);

                sign = 1;
            }
            //take out the previous calculation result from stack
            else if(c == ')'){
                ans += sign * num;
                sign = st.top();
                st.pop();
                ans = st.top() + sign*ans;
                st.pop();
                num = 0;
            }
        }
        ans += sign*num;
        return ans;
    }
