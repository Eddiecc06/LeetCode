# 768. Max Chunks To Make Sorted II
[Hard](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-chunks-to-make-sorted-ii/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array arr.

We split arr into some number of chunks (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.

Return the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [5, 4], [3, 2, 1] will result in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], which isn't sorted.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: arr = [2,1,3,4,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3, 4, 4].
However, splitting into [2, 1], [3], [4], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= arr.length <= 2000
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^8
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxChunksToSorted(vector<int>& arr) {
        stack<int>st;
        //Traverse the array from array[0] to array[n-1]
        //maxVisitedNum : Used to record the maximum number that we've traversed
        int n = arr.size(), maxVisitedNum = arr[0];
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            maxVisitedNum = max(maxVisitedNum, arr[i]);
            //If we find a new number which is larger than maxVisitedNum, it means that we can split array into 2 chunks.
            //If we find a new number which is smaller than maxVisitedNum, it means that this number must be included in the previous chunk
            while(!st.empty() && st.top() > arr[i])
                st.pop();
            //The stack is used to store
            st.push(maxVisitedNum);
        }
        return st.size();
    }
};
