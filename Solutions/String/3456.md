# 3456. Find Special Substring of Length K
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-special-substring-of-length-k/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a string s and an integer k.

Determine if there exists a substring of length exactly k in s that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The substring consists of only one distinct character (e.g., "aaa" or "bbb").
2. If there is a character immediately before the substring, it must be different from the character in the substring.
3. If there is a character immediately after the substring, it must also be different from the character in the substring.

Return true if such a substring exists. Otherwise, return false.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "aaabaaa", k = 3
Output: true
Explanation:
The substring s[4..6] == "aaa" satisfies the conditions.
It has a length of 3.
All characters are the same.
The character before "aaa" is 'b', which is different from 'a'.
There is no character after "aaa".
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "abc", k = 2
Output: false
Explanation:
There is no substring of length 2 that consists of one distinct character and satisfies the conditions.
```
**Example 3**:
```
1 <= k <= s.length <= 100
s consists of lowercase English letters only.
```

**Constraints**
```

        }
        //Check if the last 'k' characters satisfy the conditions
        if( (left == 0 || (left > 0 && s[left] != s[left-1])) && k == (right - left))
            return true;
