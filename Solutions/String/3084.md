[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-starting-and-ending-with-given-character/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a string s and a character c. Return the total number of 

substrings of s that start and end with c.

**Example 1**:
```

Input: s = "abada", c = "a"

Output: 6

Explanation: Substrings starting and ending with "a" are: "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada".
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "zzz", c = "z"

Output: 6

Explanation: There are a total of 6 substrings in s and all start and end with "z".
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s and c consist only of lowercase English letters.
```

        return ans;
    }
