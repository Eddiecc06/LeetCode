# 1963. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-swaps-to-make-the-string-balanced/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a 0-indexed string s of even length n. The string consists of exactly n / 2 opening brackets '[' and n / 2 closing brackets ']'.

A string is called balanced if and only if:

  - It is the empty string, or
  - It can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or
  - It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.
You may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.

Return the minimum number of swaps to make s balanced.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "][]["
Output: 1
Explanation: You can make the string balanced by swapping index 0 with index 3.
The resulting string is "[[]]".
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "]]][[["
Output: 2
Explanation: You can do the following to make the string balanced:
- Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][][".
- Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".
The resulting string is "[[][]]".
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "[]"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already balanced.
```

**Constraints**
```
n == s.length
2 <= n <= 10^6
n is even.
s[i] is either '[' or ']'.
The number of opening brackets '[' equals n / 2, and the number of closing brackets ']' equals n / 2.
```

            if (s[i] == '[')
                ++unbalanced;
            else if (unbalanced > 0) 
                --unbalanced;
        }
        return (unbalanced + 1) / 2;
    }
};
