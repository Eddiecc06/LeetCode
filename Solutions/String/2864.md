# 2864. Maximum Odd Binary Number
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-odd-binary-number/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.

You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.

Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "010"
Output: "001"
Explanation: Because there is just one '1', it must be in the last position. So the answer is "001".
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "0101"
Output: "1001"
Explanation: One of the '1's must be in the last position. The maximum number that can be made with the remaining digits is "100". So the answer is "1001".
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of '0' and '1'.
s contains at least one '1'.
```

                while(s[j] == '1' && j < i) // Find the first number which is 0
                    ++j;
                s[i] = s[j];
                s[j] = '1';
