# 1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the binary representation of an integer as a string s, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:

- If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.
- If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "1101"
Output: 6
Explanation: "1101" corressponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14. 
Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.
Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.  
Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.  
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "10"
Output: 1
Explanation: "10" corressponds to number 2 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "1"
Output: 0
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of characters '0' or '1'
s[0] == '1'
```

### _C++ Code_
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSteps(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if(n == 1 && s[0] == '0')
            return 1;
        int counts = 0, carry = 0;
        for(int i = n-1; i > 0; --i){
            if(s[i] == '0'){
                //No carry. Only need 1 step (divide by 2)
                if(carry == 0)
                    ++counts;
                //Have a carry. Need 2 steps :
                // First step : add 1.  Second step : divide by 2
                else{
                    counts += 2;
                    carry = 1;
                }
            }
             // '1'
            else{
                if(carry == 0) { // No carry. Need 2 steps
					counts += 2;
					carry = 1;
				}
				// Have a carry. Mean that current number will be 0. Only need 1 step (divide by 2)
				else {
					++counts;
					carry = 1;
				}
            }
        }
		return counts + carry;
    }
};
