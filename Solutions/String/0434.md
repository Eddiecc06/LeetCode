# 434. Number of Segments in a String
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-segments-in-a-string/description/

## Problem Description

Given a string s, return the number of segments in the string.

A segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5
Explanation: The five segments are ["Hello,", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "Hello"
Output: 1
```

**Constraints**
```
0 <= s.length <= 300
s consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, digits, or one of the following characters "!@#$%^&*()_+-=',.:".
The only space character in s is ' '.
```
