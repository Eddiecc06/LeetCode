# 522. Longest Uncommon Subsequence II
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-ii/description/) 

## Problem Description

Given an array of strings strs, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.

An uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not the others.

A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.

For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).

**Example 1**:
```
Input: strs = ["aba","cdc","eae"]
Output: 3
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: strs = ["aaa","aaa","aa"]
Output: -1
```

**Constraints**
```
2 <= strs.length <= 50
1 <= strs[i].length <= 10
strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
```

                    break;
            }
            //If strs[i] isn't a subsequence of any other string in strs, update the answer
            if(j == n)
                maxLen = max(maxLen, curLen);
