# 344. Reverse String
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/description/)

## Problem Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s[i] is a printable ascii character.
```
