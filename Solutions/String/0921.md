# 921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid/description/)

## Problem Description

A parentheses string is valid if and only if:

  - It is the empty string,
  - It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
  - It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
You are given a parentheses string s. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.

  - For example, if s = "()))", you can insert an opening parenthesis to be "(()))" or a closing parenthesis to be "())))".

Return the minimum number of moves required to make s valid.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "())"
Output: 1
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "((("
Output: 3
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either '(' or ')'.
```

        int left = 0, right = 0;
        for(char c : s){
            if(c == '(')
                ++left;
            else if(c == ')'){
                if(left > 0) // Additional opening parenthesis exists.
                    --left;
                else // No additional opening parenthesis exists. Need to add one to make it as a valid parenthesis
                    ++right; 
            }
        }
        return left + right;
        
    }
};
