# 3121. Count the Number of Special Characters II
[Medium]()

## Problem Description

You are given a string word. A letter c is called special if it appears both in lowercase and uppercase in word, and every lowercase occurrence of c appears before the first uppercase occurrence of c.

Return the number of special letters in word.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: word = "aaAbcBC"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The special characters are 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: word = "abc"
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no special characters in word.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: word = "AbBCab"
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no special characters in word.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= word.length <= 2 * 10^5
word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
```
