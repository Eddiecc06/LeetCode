# 539. Minimum Time Difference
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-difference/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.
 
**Example 1**:
```
Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints**
```
2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 10^4
timePoints[i] is in the format "HH:MM".
```
