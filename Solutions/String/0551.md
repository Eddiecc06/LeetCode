# 551. Student Attendance Record I
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-i/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

  - 'A': Absent.
  - 'L': Late.
  - 'P': Present.

The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

  - The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
  - The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.

Return true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false otherwise.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "PPALLP"
Output: true
Explanation: The student has fewer than 2 absences and was never late 3 or more consecutive days.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "PPALLL"
Output: false
Explanation: The student was late 3 consecutive days in the last 3 days, so is not eligible for the award.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either 'A', 'L', or 'P'.
```

                    ++late;
                else // late for non-consecutive day
                    late = 1;
            }
            if(absent >= 2 || late >= 3)
                return false;
        }
