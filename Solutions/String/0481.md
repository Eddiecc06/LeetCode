# 481. Magical String
Medium[https://leetcode.com/problems/magical-string/description/]


## Problem Description

A magical string s consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

The string s is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string s itself.

The first few elements of s is s = "1221121221221121122……". 

If we group the consecutive 1's and 2's in s, it will be "1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......" and the occurrences of 1's or 2's in each group are "1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......". 

You can see that the occurrence sequence is s itself.

Given an integer n, return the number of 1's in the first n number in the magical string s.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string s is "122112" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 10^5
```

        string magicalStr = "122";
        int i = 2;
        while (magicalStr.size() < n){
            //The regular : 
            //Get the next inserted character from magicalStr[i]
            //Get the length of next inserted string from magicalStr.back()
            //2 ^ 3 = 1, 1 ^ 3 = 2
            magicalStr += string(magicalStr[i] - '0', magicalStr.back() ^ 3);
            ++i;
        }
        return count(magicalStr.begin(), magicalStr.begin() + n, '1');
    }
};
