# 3168. Minimum Number of Chairs in a Waiting Room
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-chairs-in-a-waiting-room/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a string s. Simulate events at each second i:

  - If s[i] == 'E', a person enters the waiting room and takes one of the chairs in it.
  - If s[i] == 'L', a person leaves the waiting room, freeing up a chair.

Return the minimum number of chairs needed so that a chair is available for every person who enters the waiting room given that it is initially empty.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "EEEEEEE"
Output: 7
Explanation:
After each second, a person enters the waiting room and no person leaves it. Therefore, a minimum of 7 chairs is needed.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "ELELEEL"
Output: 2
Explanation:
Let's consider that there are 2 chairs in the waiting room. The table below shows the state of the waiting room at each second.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "ELEELEELLL"
Output: 3
Explanation:
Let's consider that there are 3 chairs in the waiting room. The table below shows the state of the waiting room at each second.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 50
s consists only of the letters 'E' and 'L'.
s represents a valid sequence of entries and exits.
```
