# 1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum/description/)

## Problem Description

You have n dice, and each dice has k faces numbered from 1 to k.

Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equals target.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 1, k = 6, target = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: You throw one die with 6 faces.
There is only one way to get a sum of 3.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 2, k = 6, target = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.
There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: n = 30, k = 30, target = 500
Output: 222616187
Explanation: The answer must be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n, k <= 30
1 <= target <= 1000
```
