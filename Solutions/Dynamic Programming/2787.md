# 2787. Ways to Express an Integer as Sum of Powers
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/ways-to-express-an-integer-as-sum-of-powers/description/)

## Problem Description

Given two positive integers n and x.

Return the number of ways n can be expressed as the sum of the xth power of unique positive integers, in other words, the number of sets of unique integers [n1, n2, ..., nk] where n = n1x + n2x + ... + nkx.

Since the result can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

For example, if n = 160 and x = 3, one way to express n is n = 23 + 33 + 53.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 10, x = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: We can express n as the following: n = 3^2 + 1^2 = 10.
It can be shown that it is the only way to express 10 as the sum of the 2nd power of unique integers.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 4, x = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: We can express n in the following ways:
- n = 4^1 = 4.
- n = 3^1 + 1^1 = 4.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 300
1 <= x <= 5
```

                break;
            int power = pow(i, x);
            for(int j = n; j >= power; --j)
                dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - power]) % mod;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
