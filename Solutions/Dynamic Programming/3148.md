# 3148. Maximum Difference Score in a Grid
[Medium]()

## Problem Description

You are given an m x n matrix grid consisting of positive integers. You can move from a cell in the matrix to any other cell that is either to the bottom or to the right (not necessarily adjacent). The score of a move from a cell with the value c1 to a cell with the value c2 is c2 - c1.

You can start at any cell, and you have to make at least one move.

Return the maximum total score you can achieve.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: grid = [[9,5,7,3],[8,9,6,1],[6,7,14,3],[2,5,3,1]]
Output: 9
Explanation: We start at the cell (0, 1), and we perform the following moves:
- Move from the cell (0, 1) to (2, 1) with a score of 7 - 5 = 2.
- Move from the cell (2, 1) to (2, 2) with a score of 14 - 7 = 7.
The total score is 2 + 7 = 9.
```

```
Input: grid = [[4,3,2],[3,2,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: We start at the cell (0, 0), and we perform one move: (0, 0) to (0, 1). The score is 3 - 4 = -1.
```

**Constraints**
```
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
2 <= m, n <= 1000
4 <= m * n <= 10^5
1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5
```

                ans = max(ans, grid[i][j] - prev);
                //Find out the minimum value on its top left area. Update the value of grid[i][j].
                grid[i][j] = min(grid[i][j], prev);
