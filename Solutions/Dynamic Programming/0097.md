# 97. Interleaving String
https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/description/

## Problem Description

Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.

An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are divided into n and m substrings respectively, such that:

s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn

t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm

|n - m| <= 1

The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...

Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
Output: true
Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 = "aa" + "bc" + "c", and s2 into s2 = "dbbc" + "a".
Interleaving the two splits, we get "aa" + "dbbc" + "bc" + "a" + "c" = "aadbbcbcac".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
Output: false
Explanation: Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""
Output: true
```

**Constraints**
```
0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
0 <= s3.length <= 200
s1, s2, and s3 consist of lowercase English letters.
```

                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] && (s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1])) || (dp[i][j-1] && (s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1]));
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
