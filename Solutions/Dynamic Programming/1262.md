# 1262. Greatest Sum Divisible by Three
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-sum-divisible-by-three/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, return the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
Output: 18
Explanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 10^4
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
```

                //We can pick nums[i] and get the sum that dividing by 3 and leaving a remainder of 'j'
                if(dp[i][ (j + nums[i]) % 3] != 0)
                    pick = nums[i] + dp[i][ (j + nums[i]) % 3];

        return dp[n][0] - 1;
