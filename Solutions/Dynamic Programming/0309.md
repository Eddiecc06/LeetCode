# 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/description/

## Problem Description

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).


**Example 1**:
```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= prices.length <= 5000
0 <= prices[i] <= 1000
```

## Solution

   Dynamic programming, array

### _C++ Code_
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
        int buy = INT_MIN, sell = 0, cold = 0;
        int prev_buy = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.size(); ++i)
        {
            prev_buy = buy; //Buy the stock yesterday
            buy = max(cold - prices[i], prev_buy); // max(cooldown yesterday and buy stock today, buy the stock yesterday)
            cold = sell; //sell the stock yesterday, today should be cooldwon
            sell = max(prev_buy + prices[i], sell); // max(buy stock yesterday and sell it today, sell the stock yesterday)
        }
        return sell;
    }
};

```
