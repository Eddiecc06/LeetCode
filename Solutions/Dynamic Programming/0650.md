# 650. 2 Keys Keyboard
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/2-keys-keyboard/description/)

## Problem Description

There is only one character 'A' on the screen of a notepad. You can perform one of two operations on this notepad for each step:

  - Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial copy is not allowed).
  - Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.

Given an integer n, return the minimum number of operations to get the character 'A' exactly n times on the screen.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially, we have one character 'A'.
In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 0
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 1000
```

        for(int i = n-1; i > 1; --i){
            // It menas that we can get smaller steps when : there're i 'A‘ on the screen and we can get n 'A'
            //by pasting i 'A‘ with (n/i) times
            if(n % i == 0)
                steps = min(steps, minSteps(n / i) + i);
        }
        return steps;
    }

### _C++ Code_
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(int n) {
        //dp[n] : The minimum number of operations to get the character 'A' exactly n times on the screen.
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = i;
            for(int j = i-1; i > 1; --j){
                if(i % j == 0){
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + i/j;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
