# 96. Unique Binary Search Trees
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/

## Problem Description

Given an integer n, return the number of structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```


**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 19
```

## Solution

### The explanation of dynamic programming rule

    We assume that dp[n] is the number of binary trees can be generated with n numbers:
    Since empty tree is also a kind of tree, assume dp[0] = 1.
    For n = 1 : the head should be 1 only. Only one possible binary tree.
    
    For n = 2 : The heaa could be 1 or 2. Then,
    dp[2] = dp[0]*dp[1] (If the head is 1. Left possible binary tree will be empty (dp[0]). Right possible binary tree will be generated with 1 number : 2(dp[1])
          + dp[1]*dp[0] (If the head is 2. Left possible binary tree will be generated with 1 number : 1(dp[1]). Right possible binary tree will be empty (dp[0])
    
    For n = 3 : The heaa could be 1 or 2 or 3. Then,
    dp[3] = dp[0]*dp[2] (If the head is 1. Left possible binary tree will be empty (dp[0]). Right possible binary tree will be generated with 2 number : 2, 3(dp[2])
          + dp[1]*dp[1] (If the head is 2. Left possible binary tree will be generated with 1 number : 1(dp[1]). Right possible binary tree will be generated with 1 number : 3(dp[1])
          + dp[2]*dp[0] (If the head is 3. Left possible binary tree will be generated with 2 number : 1, 2(dp[2]). Right possible binary tree will be empty (dp[0])
 
    For n = 4 : The heaa could be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4. Then,
    dp[4] = dp[0]*dp[3] (If the head is 1. Left possible binary tree will be empty (dp[0]). Right possible binary tree will be generated with 3 number : 2, 3, 4(dp[3])
          + dp[1]*dp[2] (If the head is 2. Left possible binary tree will be generated with 1 number : 1(dp[1]). Right possible binary tree will be generated with 2 number : 3, 4(dp[2])
          + dp[2]*dp[1] (If the head is 3. Left possible binary tree will be generated with 2 number : 1, 2(dp[2]). Right possible binary tree will be generated with 1 number : 4(dp[1])
          + dp[3]*dp[0] (If the head is 4. Left possible binary tree will be generated with 3 number : 1, 2, 3(dp[3]). Right possible binary tree will be empty (dp[0])
    ......
    It's Catalan number, the rule is :
