# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/description/

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions: i.e. you may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).


**Example 1**:
```
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= k <= 100
1 <= prices.length <= 1000
0 <= prices[i] <= 1000
```

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int> &prices) {

        if (k >= prices.size()) //the case that we can trade with unlimited times. Similar to Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II 
            return solveMaxProfit(prices);
        // global_maxProfits[i] : The maximum profits we can get with at most i transactions
        // local_maxProfits[i] : The maximum profits we can get with at most i transactions and we send the stock on the last day 
        vector<int> global_maxProfits(k+1, 0), local_maxProfits(k+1, 0);
        int diff;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i){
            diff = prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            for(int j = k; j > 0; --j){
                //Since we define "local_maxProfits" as sending the stock on the last day. "local_maxProfits[j] + diff" still means that we treate at most j transactions
                local_maxProfits[j] = max(global_maxProfits[j-1] + max(0, diff),  local_maxProfits[j] + diff);
                global_maxProfits[j] = max(local_maxProfits[j], global_maxProfits[j]);
            }
        }
        return global_maxProfits[k];
    }
    int solveMaxProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        int res = 0;
        int profits = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i)
            profits += max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1]);
        return profits;
    }
};
```

- _Time Complexity_: O(k*N) // N : the size of vector "prices"
- _Space Complexity_ï¼šO(k)
