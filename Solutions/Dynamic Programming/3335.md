# 3335. Total Characters in String After Transformations I
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-characters-in-string-after-transformations-i/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a string s and an integer t, representing the number of transformations to perform. In one transformation, every character in s is replaced according to the following rules:

  - If the character is 'z', replace it with the string "ab".
  - Otherwise, replace it with the next character in the alphabet. For example, 'a' is replaced with 'b', 'b' is replaced with 'c', and so on.

Return the length of the resulting string after exactly t transformations.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2
Output: 7
Explanation:
First Transformation (t = 1):
'a' becomes 'b'
'b' becomes 'c'
'c' becomes 'd'
'y' becomes 'z'
'y' becomes 'z'
String after the first transformation: "bcdzz"
Second Transformation (t = 2):
'b' becomes 'c'
'c' becomes 'd'
'd' becomes 'e'
'z' becomes "ab"
'z' becomes "ab"
String after the second transformation: "cdeabab"
Final Length of the string: The string is "cdeabab", which has 7 characters.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "azbk", t = 1
Output: 5
Explanation:
First Transformation (t = 1):
'a' becomes 'b'
'z' becomes "ab"
'b' becomes 'c'
'k' becomes 'l'
String after the first transformation: "babcl"
Final Length of the string: The string is "babcl", which has 5 characters.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
1 <= t <= 10^5
```

        //dp[i] : The length of string starting from the character 'a' after 'i' transformation
        vector<int> dp(t + 26);
        //Initialize the case of transformation 1 to 26
        for(int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
            dp[i] = 1;
        for(int i = 26; i < t + 26; ++i)
            //After one transformation, 'z' will be changed to 'a' and 'b'.
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 26] + dp[i - 25]) % mod;
        //Calculate the length of string
        for(char ch : s)
            ans = (ans + dp[ch - 'a' + t]) % mod;
        return ans;
    }
