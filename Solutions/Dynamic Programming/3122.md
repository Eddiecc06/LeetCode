# 3122. Minimum Number of Operations to Satisfy Conditions
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-satisfy-conditions/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a 2D matrix grid of size m x n. In one operation, you can change the value of any cell to any non-negative number. You need to perform some operations such that each cell grid[i][j] is:

  - Equal to the cell below it, i.e. grid[i][j] == grid[i + 1][j] (if it exists).
  - Different from the cell to its right, i.e. grid[i][j] != grid[i][j + 1] (if it exists).

Return the minimum number of operations needed.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,2],[1,0,2]]
Output: 0
```

All the cells in the matrix already satisfy the properties.

**Example 2**:
```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: 3
```

The matrix becomes [[1,0,1],[1,0,1]] which satisfies the properties, by doing these 3 operations:

  - Change grid[1][0] to 1.
  - Change grid[0][1] to 0.
  - Change grid[1][2] to 1.


**Example 3**:
```
Input: grid = [[1],[2],[3]]
Output: 2
```

There is a single column. We can change the value to 1 in each cell using 2 operations.

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n, m <= 1000
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 9
```
