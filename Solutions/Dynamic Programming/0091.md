# 91. Decode Ways
https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/description/

## Problem Description

 message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)

"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 100
s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).
```

class Solution {
public:
    int numDecodings(string s) {
        if (s[0] == '0')
        return 0;
        // If current index of s is "i"
        //dp0 : the number of possible encoded message got from s[0] ~ s[i] and s[i-1] + s[i] is combined as a letter 
        //dp1 : the number of possible encoded message got from s[0] ~ s[i] and s[i] is encoded a letter 
        int dp0 = 1, dp1 = 1;
        int tmp;
        for(int i = 1; i < s.size(); ++i){
            //If s[i] = '0', meaning that s[i] must be combined with s[i-1] or s[i+1].
            //s[i] can't be a letter by itself. So, we assign 0 to dp1
            if(s[i] == '0')
                dp1 = 0;
            // the case that s[i] & s[i-1] can be encoded to a letter
            if(s[i-1] == '1' || (s[i-1] == '2' && s[i] <= '6')){
                tmp = dp1;
                dp1 = dp0 + dp1;
                dp0 = tmp;
            }
            else
                dp0 = dp1;
        }
        return dp1;
    }
