# 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
```
