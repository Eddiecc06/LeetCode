# 464. Can I Win
https://leetcode.com/problems/can-i-win/description/

## Problem Description

In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10.

The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers maxChoosableInteger and desiredTotal, return true if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return false. Assume both players play optimally.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
Output: false
Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0
Output: true
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1
Output: true
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20
0 <= desiredTotal <= 300
```
