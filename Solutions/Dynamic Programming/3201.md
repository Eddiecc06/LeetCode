# 3201. Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence I
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-length-of-valid-subsequence-i/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array nums.
A subsequence sub of nums with length x is called valid if it satisfies:

- (sub[0] + sub[1]) % 2 == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % 2 == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % 2.
- Return the length of the longest valid subsequence of nums.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The longest valid subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,1,2,1,2]
Output: 6
Explanation:
The longest valid subsequence is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2].
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The longest valid subsequence is [1, 3].
```

**Constraints**
```
2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^7
```
