# 2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-build-good-strings/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

  - Append the character '0' zero times.
  - Append the character '1' one times.

This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: 
One possible valid good string is "011". 
It can be constructed as follows: "" -> "0" -> "01" -> "011". 
All binary strings from "000" to "111" are good strings in this example.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: low = 2, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The good strings are "00", "11", "000", "110", and "011".
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= low <= high <= 10^5
1 <= zero, one <= low
```

                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - one]) % mod;
            
            if(i - low >= 0)
                ans = (ans + dp[i]) % mod;
        }
