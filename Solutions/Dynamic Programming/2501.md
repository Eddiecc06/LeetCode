# 2501. Longest Square Streak in an Array
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-square-streak-in-an-array/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array nums. A subsequence of nums is called a square streak if:

  - The length of the subsequence is at least 2, and
  - after sorting the subsequence, each element (except the first element) is the square of the previous number.

Return the length of the longest square streak in nums, or return -1 if there is no square streak.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [4,3,6,16,8,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Choose the subsequence [4,16,2]. After sorting it, it becomes [2,4,16].
- 4 = 2 * 2.
- 16 = 4 * 4.
Therefore, [4,16,2] is a square streak.
It can be shown that every subsequence of length 4 is not a square streak.

```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,5,6,7]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no square streak in nums so return -1.
```

**Constraints**
```
2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
2 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
```

        //maxNum : The maximum number in the array 'nums'
        int n = nums.size(), maxNum = -1;
        int ans = -1;
        //dp[i] :  The length of longest Square subsequence can get from the array 'nums'
        vector<int> dp(100001, 0);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            dp[nums[i]] = 1;
            maxNum = max(maxNum, nums[i]);
        }
        
        for(int i = 2; i <= maxNum; ++i){
            //Update dp[i] if it's a square of a number
            if(dp[i] && (int)sqrt(i)*(int)sqrt(i) == i){
                dp[i] += dp[(int)sqrt(i)];
                ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
            }
        }
        if(ans == 1)
            return -1;
        return ans;
    }
};
