# 740. Delete and Earn
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

  - Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.

Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
```

class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = 10001;
        int pick = 0, skip = 0;
        vector<int> values(n, 0);
        for (int num : nums)
            values[num] += num;

        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            //Pick the number 'i' when previous number 'i-1' isn't picked
            int pickLast = skip + values[i];
            //Skip to pick the number 'i'. The maximum value we can get is max(pick, skip);
            int skipLast = max(skip, pick);
            pick = pickLast;
            skip = skipLast;
        }
        return max(pick, skip);
    }
};
