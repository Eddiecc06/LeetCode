# 75. Sort Colors
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/

## Problem Description

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

**Constraints**
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
```

        int n = nums.size();
        //The first object will be red. The last object will be blue. 
        //Initialize "red" pointer and "blue" pointer
        int red = 0, blue = n - 1, curIndex = 0;
        while(curIndex <= blue){
            cout<<curIndex<<" ";
            //If current object is 0, put it to the place "red" pointer 
            if(nums[curIndex] == 0)
                swap(nums[curIndex], nums[red++]);
            //If current object is 0, put it to the place "blue" pointer 
            else if(nums[curIndex] == 2)
                swap(nums[curIndex--], nums[blue--]);
            curIndex++;
        }
        return;
    }
