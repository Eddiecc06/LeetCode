# 2033. Minimum Operations to Make a Uni-Value Grid
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-uni-value-grid/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a 2D integer grid of size m x n and an integer x. In one operation, you can add x to or subtract x from any element in the grid.

A uni-value grid is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.

Return the minimum number of operations to make the grid uni-value. If it is not possible, return -1.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: grid = [[2,4],[6,8]], x = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: We can make every element equal to 4 by doing the following: 
- Add x to 2 once.
- Subtract x from 6 once.
- Subtract x from 8 twice.
A total of 4 operations were used.
```

```
Input: grid = [[1,5],[2,3]], x = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: We can make every element equal to 3.
```

```
Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]], x = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to make every element equal.
```

**Constraints**
```
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 10^5
1 <= m * n <= 10^5
1 <= x, grid[i][j] <= 10^4
```

            if(num % x != medianNum % x) //It is not possible to get a Uni-Value grid. return -1.
                return -1;
            ans += abs(medianNum - num) / x;
        }
