# 692. Top K Frequent Words
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= words.length <= 500
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
k is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]]
```

    }
    static bool compare(pair<string, int> &a, pair<string, int> &b){
        //Sort the table according to the count of word
        if(a.second > b.second)
            return true;
        //If the count of two words are the same, sort the word according to their characters
        if(a.second == b.second){
            if(a.first < b.first)
                return true;
