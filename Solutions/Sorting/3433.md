# 3433. Count Mentions Per User
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-mentions-per-user/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an integer numberOfUsers representing the total number of users and an array events of size n x 3.

Each events[i] can be either of the following two types:

1. Message Event: ["MESSAGE", "timestampi", "mentions_stringi"]
  - This event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at timestampi.
  - The mentions_stringi string can contain one of the following tokens:
    - id<number>: where <number> is an integer in range [0,numberOfUsers - 1]. There can be multiple ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.
    - ALL: mentions all users.
    - HERE: mentions all online users.
2. Offline Event: ["OFFLINE", "timestampi", "idi"]
  - This event indicates that the user idi had become offline at timestampi for 60 time units. The user will automatically be online again at time timestampi + 60.

Return an array mentions where mentions[i] represents the number of mentions the user with id i has across all MESSAGE events.

All users are initially online, and if a user goes offline or comes back online, their status change is processed before handling any message event that occurs at the same timestamp.

Note that a user can be mentioned multiple times in a single message event, and each mention should be counted separately.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [["MESSAGE","10","id1 id0"],["OFFLINE","11","0"],["MESSAGE","71","HERE"]]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
Initially, all users are online.
At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]
At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.
At timestamp 71, id0 comes back online and "HERE" is mentioned. mentions = [2,2]
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [["MESSAGE","10","id1 id0"],["OFFLINE","11","0"],["MESSAGE","12","ALL"]]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
Initially, all users are online.
At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]
At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.
At timestamp 12, "ALL" is mentioned. This includes offline users, so both id0 and id1 are mentioned. mentions = [2,2]
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [["OFFLINE","10","0"],["MESSAGE","12","HERE"]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation:
Initially, all users are online.
At timestamp 10, id0 goes offline.
At timestamp 12, "HERE" is mentioned. Because id0 is still offline, they will not be mentioned. mentions = [0,1]
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= numberOfUsers <= 100
1 <= events.length <= 100
events[i].length == 3
events[i][0] will be one of MESSAGE or OFFLINE.
1 <= int(events[i][1]) <= 10^5
The number of id<number> mentions in any "MESSAGE" event is between 1 and 100.
0 <= <number> <= numberOfUsers - 1
It is guaranteed that the user id referenced in the OFFLINE event is online at the time the event occurs.
```
