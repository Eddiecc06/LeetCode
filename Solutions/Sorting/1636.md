# 1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-increasing-frequency/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values.

If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order.

Return the sorted array.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]
Explanation: '3' has a frequency of 1, '1' has a frequency of 2, and '2' has a frequency of 3.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,3,2]
Output: [1,3,3,2,2]
Explanation: '2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in decreasing order.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]
Output: [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 100
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> frequencySort(vector<int>& nums){
        //The range of nums is :  -100 <= nums[i] <= 100. Therefore, create a vector with size = 200
        vector<int> counts(201, 0);
        for(int num : nums)
            ++counts[num + 100];

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [&](int x, int y){
            if(counts[x + 100] < counts[y + 100])
                return 1;
            if(counts[x + 100] > counts[y + 100])
                return 0;
            //The count of number x and number y is the same. Sort them according to its value
            return (int) (x > y);
        });
        return nums;
    }
};
