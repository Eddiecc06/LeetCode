# 1402. Reducing Dishes
https://leetcode.com/problems/reducing-dishes/description/

## Problem Description

A chef has collected data on the satisfaction level of his n dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. time[i] * satisfaction[i].

Return the maximum sum of like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation.

Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]
Output: 14
Explanation: After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total like-time coefficient will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14).
Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.
```
**Example2**:
```
Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2]
Output: 20
Explanation: Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20)
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5]
Output: 0
Explanation: People do not like the dishes. No dish is prepared.
```

**Constraints**
```
n == satisfaction.length
1 <= n <= 500
-1000 <= satisfaction[i] <= 1000
```
