# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals
https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/


## Problem Description

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5
intervals[i].length == 2
-5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4
```

class Solution {
public:

    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        //Sort the intervals by comparing intervals[0:i][1] in increasing order
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const vector<int>&v1, const vector<int>&v2){
            return v1[1] < v2[1];
        });
        int prev = 0, ans = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); ++i){
            if(intervals[prev][1] > intervals[i][0]) //Means that intervals[prev] and intervals[i] overlaps
                ++ans;
            else    // vals[prev] and intervals[i] don't overlap. Update the index "prev" as current index "i"
                prev = i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
