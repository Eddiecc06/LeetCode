# 1887. Reduction Operations to Make the Array Elements Equal
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/reduction-operations-to-make-the-array-elements-equal/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-11-19)

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, your goal is to make all elements in nums equal. To complete one operation, follow these steps:

- Find the largest value in nums. Let its index be i (0-indexed) and its value be largest. If there are multiple elements with the largest value, pick the smallest i.
- Find the next largest value in nums strictly smaller than largest. Let its value be nextLargest.
- Reduce nums[i] to nextLargest.

Return the number of operations to make all elements in nums equal.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [5,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: It takes 3 operations to make all elements in nums equal:
1. largest = 5 at index 0. nextLargest = 3. Reduce nums[0] to 3. nums = [3,1,3].
2. largest = 3 at index 0. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[0] to 1. nums = [1,1,3].
3. largest = 3 at index 2. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[2] to 1. nums = [1,1,1].
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All elements in nums are already equal.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: It takes 4 operations to make all elements in nums equal:
1. largest = 3 at index 4. nextLargest = 2. Reduce nums[4] to 2. nums = [1,1,2,2,2].
2. largest = 2 at index 2. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[2] to 1. nums = [1,1,1,2,2].
3. largest = 2 at index 3. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[3] to 1. nums = [1,1,1,1,2].
4. largest = 2 at index 4. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[4] to 1. nums = [1,1,1,1,1].
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
1 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4
```

class Solution {
public:
    int reductionOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(), counts = 0;
        //Sort the array with increasing order
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        for(int i = n-1; i >= 0; --i){
            //current number is the smallest one. Don't need more operation
            if(nums[0] == nums[i])
                break;
            //Need to change the largest value number to the second largest value
            //For example : nums = [2, 3, 3] --> when we visited nums[1] = 3, we found that nums[1] != nums[0]
            //It means that we should do one operation for the numbers nums[1 ... 2]
            else if(nums[i] != nums[i-1])
                counts += (n-1 -i + 1);
        }
        return counts;

    }
};
