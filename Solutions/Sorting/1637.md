# 1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/widest-vertical-area-between-two-points-containing-no-points/description/)

## Problem Description

Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints**
```
n == points.length
2 <= n <= 10^5
points[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi <= 10^9
```

        //sort the pointers based on 'x' coordinate in increasing order
        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [](const vector<int> &a, const vector<int> &b){
            return a[0] < b[0];
        });
        int width, maxWidth = 0, n = points.size();
        for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
            width = points[i][0] - points[i-1][0];
            maxWidth = max(maxWidth, width);
        }
        return maxWidth;
    }
