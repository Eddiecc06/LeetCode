# 3462. Maximum Sum With at Most K Elements
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-with-at-most-k-elements/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a 2D integer matrix grid of size n x m, an integer array limits of length n, and an integer k. The task is to find the maximum sum of at most k elements from the matrix grid such that:

  - The number of elements taken from the ith row of grid does not exceed limits[i].

Return the maximum sum.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]], limits = [1,2], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation:
From the second row, we can take at most 2 elements. The elements taken are 4 and 3.
The maximum possible sum of at most 2 selected elements is 4 + 3 = 7.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: grid = [[5,3,7],[8,2,6]], limits = [2,2], k = 3
Output: 21
Explanation:
From the first row, we can take at most 2 elements. The element taken is 7.
From the second row, we can take at most 2 elements. The elements taken are 8 and 6.
The maximum possible sum of at most 3 selected elements is 7 + 8 + 6 = 21.
```

**Constraints**
```
n == grid.length == limits.length
m == grid[i].length
1 <= n, m <= 500
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5
0 <= limits[i] <= m
0 <= k <= min(n * m, sum(limits))
```

        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        long long maxSum = 0; 
        for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i){
            sort(grid[i].begin(), grid[i].end(), greater<int>());
            for(int j = 0; j < limits[i]; ++j)
                largeNum.push_back(grid[i][j]);
        }
        //Sort the stored number in decreasing order
        sort(largeNum.begin(), largeNum.end(), greater<int>());
        for(int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
            maxSum += largeNum[i];
        return maxSum;
    }
