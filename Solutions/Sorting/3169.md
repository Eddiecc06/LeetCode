# 3169. Count Days Without Meetings
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-days-without-meetings/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a positive integer days representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1).

You are also given a 2D array meetings of size n where, meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i] represents the starting and ending days of meeting i (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

Note: The meetings may overlap.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: days = 10, meetings = [[5,7],[1,3],[9,10]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is no meeting scheduled on the 4th and 8th days.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: days = 5, meetings = [[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
There is no meeting scheduled on the 5th day.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: days = 6, meetings = [[1,6]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Meetings are scheduled for all working days.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= days <= 10^9
1 <= meetings.length <= 10^5
meetings[i].length == 2
1 <= meetings[i][0] <= meetings[i][1] <= days
```

        for(auto meet : MergedMeetings){
            int start = meet[0], end = meet[1];
            meetingdays += (end - start + 1);
        }
        return days - meetingdays;
