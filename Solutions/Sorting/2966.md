# 2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-into-arrays-with-max-difference/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k.

Divide the array into one or more arrays of size 3 satisfying the following conditions:

  - Each element of nums should be in exactly one array.
  - The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.

Return a 2D array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2
Output: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]
Explanation: We can divide the array into the following arrays: [1,1,3], [3,4,5] and [7,8,9].
The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.
Note that the order of elements is not important.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,3,2,7,3], k = 3
Output: []
Explanation: It is not possible to divide the array satisfying all the conditions.
```

**Constraints**
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
n is a multiple of 3.
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
1 <= k <= 10^5
```

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i += 3){
            if(i + 2 < n && nums[i+2] - nums[i] <= k){
                ans[index] = {nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2]};
                ++index; 
            }
            else //it is impossible to satisfy the conditions
                return {};
        }
        return ans;
    }
