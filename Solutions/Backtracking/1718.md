# 1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-lexicographically-largest-valid-sequence/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer n, find a sequence with elements in the range [1, n] that satisfies all of the following:

  - The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.
  - Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
  - For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.

The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|.

Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.

A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: [3,1,2,3,2]
Explanation: [2,3,2,1,3] is also a valid sequence, but [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 5
Output: [5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2
```


**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 20
```
