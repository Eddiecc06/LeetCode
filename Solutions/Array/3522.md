# 3522. Calculate Score After Performing Instructions
[Medium](http://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-score-after-performing-instructions/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given two arrays, instructions and values, both of size n. You need to simulate a process based on the following rules:

  - You start at the first instruction at index i = 0 with an initial score of 0.
  - If instructions[i] is "add":
    - Add values[i] to your score.
    - Move to the next instruction (i + 1).
  - If instructions[i] is "jump":
    - Move to the instruction at index (i + values[i]) without modifying your score.

The process ends when you either:

  - Go out of bounds (i.e., i < 0 or i >= n), or
  - Attempt to revisit an instruction that has been previously executed. The revisited instruction is not executed.

Return your score at the end of the process.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: instructions = ["jump","add","add","jump","add","jump"], values = [2,1,3,1,-2,-3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Simulate the process starting at instruction 0:
At index 0: Instruction is "jump", move to index 0 + 2 = 2.
At index 2: Instruction is "add", add values[2] = 3 to your score and move to index 3. Your score becomes 3.
At index 3: Instruction is "jump", move to index 3 + 1 = 4.
At index 4: Instruction is "add", add values[4] = -2 to your score and move to index 5. Your score becomes 1.
At index 5: Instruction is "jump", move to index 5 + (-3) = 2.
At index 2: Already visited. The process ends.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: instructions = ["jump","add","add"], values = [3,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Simulate the process starting at instruction 0:
At index 0: Instruction is "jump", move to index 0 + 3 = 3.
At index 3: Out of bounds. The process ends.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: instructions = ["jump"], values = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Simulate the process starting at instruction 0:
At index 0: Instruction is "jump", move to index 0 + 0 = 0.
At index 0: Already visited. The process ends.
```

**Constraints**
```
n == instructions.length == values.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
instructions[i] is either "add" or "jump".
-10^5 <= values[i] <= 10^5
```

            }
        }
        return score;
    }
