# 1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-is-sorted-and-rotated/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.

There may be duplicates in the original array.

Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that B[i] == A[(i+x) % A.length] for every valid index i.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
```
