# 2718. Sum of Matrix After Queries
https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-matrix-after-queries/description/

## Problem Description

You are given an integer n and a 0-indexed 2D array queries where queries[i] = [typei, indexi, vali].

Initially, there is a 0-indexed n x n matrix filled with 0's. For each query, you must apply one of the following changes:

if typei == 0, set the values in the row with indexi to vali, overwriting any previous values.

if typei == 1, set the values in the column with indexi to vali, overwriting any previous values.

Return the sum of integers in the matrix after all queries are applied.

```
Input: n = 3, queries = [[0,0,1],[1,2,2],[0,2,3],[1,0,4]]
Output: 23
Explanation: The image above describes the matrix after each query. The sum of the matrix after all queries are applied is 23.
```

```
Input: n = 3, queries = [[0,0,4],[0,1,2],[1,0,1],[0,2,3],[1,2,1]]
Output: 17
Explanation: The image above describes the matrix after each query. The sum of the matrix after all queries are applied is 17.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 10^4
1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4
queries[i].length == 3
0 <= typei <= 1
0 <= indexi < n
0 <= vali <= 10^5
```

        int row = n, col = n;
        //Used to recordr the number of row has been updated. 
        int changedRowNum = 0, changedColNum = 0;
        long long sum = 0;
        // changedRow : Used to record with row has been updated
        // changedCol : Used to record with column has been updated
        vector<bool> changedRow(n, false), changedCol(n, false);
        //Traverse queries from the end to the beginning since the earlier query on the same element will be overwritten by the later query
        for(int i = queries.size()-1; i >= 0; --i){
            if(queries[i][0] == 0 && changedRow[queries[i][1]] == false){ //set the values in the row with indexi to vali
                changedRow[queries[i][1]] = true;
                sum += (long long)(queries[i][2] * (row - changedColNum));
                ++changedRowNum;
            }
            else if(queries[i][0] == 1 && changedCol[queries[i][1]] == false){//set the values in the column with indexi to vali
                changedCol[queries[i][1]] = true;
                sum += (long long)(queries[i][2] * (col - changedRowNum));
                ++changedColNum;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
