# 3531. Count Covered Buildings
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-covered-buildings/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a positive integer n, representing an n x n city. You are also given a 2D grid buildings, where buildings[i] = [x, y] denotes a unique building located at coordinates [x, y].

A building is covered if there is at least one building in all four directions: left, right, above, and below.

Return the number of covered buildings.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2],[2,1],[2,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Only building [2,2] is covered as it has at least one building:
above ([1,2])
below ([3,2])
left ([2,1])
right ([2,3])
Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
No building has at least one building in all four directions.
```
**Example 3**:

```
Input: n = 5, buildings = [[1,3],[3,2],[3,3],[3,5],[5,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Only building [3,3] is covered as it has at least one building:
above ([1,3])
below ([5,3])
left ([3,2])
right ([3,5])
Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
```

**Constraints**
```
2 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= buildings.length <= 10^5 
buildings[i] = [x, y]
1 <= x, y <= n
All coordinates of buildings are unique.
```

   Array

### _C++ Code_
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countCoveredBuildings(int n, vector<vector<int>>& buildings){
        //minRows[y] : Record the minimum Row of the buildings on column 'y'
        //maxRows[y] : Record the maximum Row of the buildings on column 'y'
        //minCols[x] : Record the minimum Column of the buildings on row 'x'
        //maxCols[x] : Record the maximum Column of the buildings on row 'x'
        vector<int> minRows(n+1, n+2), maxRows(n+1, 0);
        vector<int> minCols(n+1, n+2), maxCols(n+1, 0);
        int ans = 0, x, y; 
        for(auto & build : buildings){
            x = build[0];
            y = build[1];
            minRows[y] = min(minRows[y], x);
            maxRows[y] = max(maxRows[y], x);
            minCols[x] = min(minCols[x], y);
            maxCols[x] = max(maxCols[x], y);
        }
        for(auto & build : buildings){
            x = build[0];
            y = build[1];
            //A building is covered
            if(x > minRows[y] && x < maxRows[y] && y > minCols[x] && y < maxCols[x])
                ++ans;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
