# 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/description/)

## Problem Description

We have two special characters:

  - The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
  - The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
So the last character is not one-bit character.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= bits.length <= 1000
bits[i] is either 0 or 1.
```

                ++i;
            else //It's must be a two-bits character if bits[i] is 1
                i += 2;
        }
        return i == n-1;
    }
