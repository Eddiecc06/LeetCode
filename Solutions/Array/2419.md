# 2419. Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-with-maximum-bitwise-and/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array nums of size n.

Consider a non-empty subarray from nums that has the maximum possible bitwise AND.

- In other words, let k be the maximum value of the bitwise AND of any subarray of nums. Then, only subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to k should be considered. Return the length of the longest such subarray.

The bitwise AND of an array is the bitwise AND of all the numbers in it.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 3.
The longest subarray with that value is [3,3], so we return 2.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 4.
The longest subarray with that value is [4], so we return 1.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
```

        //curLength : The length of subarray with largest bitwise AND value
        int LargestNum = 0, ans = 0, curLength = 0;
        for(int num : nums){
            //Find a new larger number
            if(LargestNum < num){
                LargestNum = num;
                ans = 1;
                curLength = 1;
            }
            else if (LargestNum == num)
                ++curLength;
            else
                curLength = 0;
            ans = max(ans, curLength);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
