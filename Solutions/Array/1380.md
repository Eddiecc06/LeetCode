# 1380. Lucky Numbers in a Matrix 
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/lucky-numbers-in-a-matrix/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an m x n matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
Output: [15]
Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]
Output: [12]
Explanation: 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]]
Output: [7]
Explanation: 7 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
```

**Constraints**
```
m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
1 <= n, m <= 50
1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5.
All elements in the matrix are distinct.
```

        for(vector<int> &m : matrix){
            //minColumn : The column which the element is the minimun number in current row.
            minColumn = 0;
            for(int i = 1; i < col; ++i){
                if(m[minColumn] > m[i])
                    minColumn = i;
            }
            //maxNumber : The maximum number at the column 'minColumn'
            maxNumber = m[minColumn];
            for(int j = 0; j < row; ++j)
                maxNumber = max(maxNumber, matrix[j][minColumn]);
            //Check if m[minIndex] is a lucky number
            if(maxNumber == m[minColumn])
                return {maxNumber};
        }
        return {};
    }
