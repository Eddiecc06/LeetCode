# 3446. Sort Matrix by Diagonals
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-matrix-by-diagonals/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an n x n square matrix of integers grid. Return the matrix such that:

- The diagonals in the bottom-left triangle (including the middle diagonal) are sorted in non-increasing order.
- The diagonals in the top-right triangle are sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: grid = [[1,7,3],[9,8,2],[4,5,6]]
Output: [[8,2,3],[9,6,7],[4,5,1]]
Explanation:

```
The diagonals with a black arrow (bottom-left triangle) should be sorted in non-increasing order:
- [1, 8, 6] becomes [8, 6, 1].
- [9, 5] and [4] remain unchanged.
The diagonals with a blue arrow (top-right triangle) should be sorted in non-decreasing order:
- [7, 2] becomes [2, 7].
- [3] remains unchanged.
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: [[2,1],[1,0]]
Explanation:
```

```
The diagonals with a black arrow must be non-increasing, so [0, 2] is changed to [2, 0]. The other diagonals are already in the correct order.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: grid = [[1]]
Output: [[1]]
Explanation:
Diagonals with exactly one element are already in order, so no changes are needed.
```

**Constraints**
```
grid.length == grid[i].length == n
1 <= n <= 10
-105 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5
```
