[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/three-consecutive-odds/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer array arr, return true if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return false.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
Output: false
Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
Output: true
Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.

**Constraints**
```
1 <= arr.length <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
```
