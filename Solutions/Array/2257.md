# 2257. Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-unguarded-cells-in-the-grid/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowi, coli] and walls[j] = [rowj, colj] represent the positions of the ith guard and jth wall respectively.

A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.

Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.

```
Input: m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The guarded and unguarded cells are shown in red and green respectively in the above diagram.
There are a total of 7 unguarded cells, so we return 7.
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, guards = [[1,1]], walls = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The unguarded cells are shown in green in the above diagram.
There are a total of 4 unguarded cells, so we return 4.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= m, n <= 10^5
2 <= m * n <= 10^5
1 <= guards.length, walls.length <= 5 * 10^4
2 <= guards.length + walls.length <= m * n
guards[i].length == walls[j].length == 2
0 <= rowi, rowj < m
0 <= coli, colj < n
All the positions in guards and walls are unique.
```

                int directX = d[0], directY = d[1];
                //g[x + directX][y + directY] < 2 : It means that the cell grid[x + directX][y + directY] is not a wall / guard 
                while(x + directX >= 0 && x + directX < m && y + directY >= 0 && y + directY < n && grid[x + directX][y + directY] < 2){
                    x += directX;
                    y += directY;
                    grid[x][y] = 1;
                }
            }
        }

        //Calculate the number of unoccupied cells
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i){
            for(int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); ++j){
                if(grid[i][j] == 0)
