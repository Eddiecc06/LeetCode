# 2593. Find Score of an Array After Marking All Elements
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-score-of-an-array-after-marking-all-elements/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

Starting with score = 0, apply the following algorithm:

  - Choose the smallest integer of the array that is not marked. If there is a tie, choose the one with the smallest index.
  - Add the value of the chosen integer to score.
  - Mark the chosen element and its two adjacent elements if they exist.
  - Repeat until all the array elements are marked.

Return the score you get after applying the above algorithm.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [2,1,3,4,5,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: We mark the elements as follows:
- 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
- 2 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its left adjacent element: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
- 4 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
Our score is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,5,1,3,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: We mark the elements as follows:
- 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: [2,3,5,1,3,2].
- 2 is the smallest unmarked element, since there are two of them, we choose the left-most one, so we mark the one at index 0 and its right adjacent element: [2,3,5,1,3,2].
- 2 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: [2,3,5,1,3,2].
Our score is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
```
