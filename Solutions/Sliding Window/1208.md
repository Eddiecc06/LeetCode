# 1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.

You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd".
That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
t.length == s.length
0 <= maxCost <= 10^6
s and t consist of only lowercase English letters.
```

        int n = s.length(), start = 0, end, maxlength = 0;
        for(end = 0; end < n; ++end){
            maxCost -= abs(s[end] - t[end]);
            //Exceed the maximum available cost. Need to move left side of sliding window
            while(maxCost < 0){
                maxCost += abs(s[start] - t[start]);
                ++start;
            }
            maxlength = max(maxlength, end - start+1);
        }
        return maxlength;
    }
