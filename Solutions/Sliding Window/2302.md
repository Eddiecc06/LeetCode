# 2302. Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K
[Hard](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-score-less-than-k/description/)

## Problem Description

The score of an array is defined as the product of its sum and its length.

  - For example, the score of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) * 5 = 75.

Given a positive integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays of nums whose score is strictly less than k.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [2,1,4,3,5], k = 10
Output: 6
Explanation:
The 6 subarrays having scores less than 10 are:
- [2] with score 2 * 1 = 2.
- [1] with score 1 * 1 = 1.
- [4] with score 4 * 1 = 4.
- [3] with score 3 * 1 = 3. 
- [5] with score 5 * 1 = 5.
- [2,1] with score (2 + 1) * 2 = 6.
Note that subarrays such as [1,4] and [4,3,5] are not considered because their scores are 10 and 36 respectively, while we need scores strictly less than 10.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation:
Every subarray except [1,1,1] has a score less than 5.
[1,1,1] has a score (1 + 1 + 1) * 3 = 9, which is greater than 5.
Thus, there are 5 subarrays having scores less than 5.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
1 <= k <= 10^15
```

        while(right < n){
            sum += nums[right];
            //If the score of current subarray (sliding wiindow) is larger than /eqaul to k,
            //move the left side of sliding winduw until the score is less than k
            while(sum * (right - left + 1) >= k){
                sum -= nums[left];
                ++left;
            }
            counts += (right - left + 1);
            ++right;
        }
        return counts;
    }
};
