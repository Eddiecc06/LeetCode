# 1513. Number of Substrings With Only 1s
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-with-only-1s/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a binary string s, return the number of substrings with all characters 1's. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "0110111"
Output: 9
Explanation: There are 9 substring in total with only 1's characters.
"1" -> 5 times.
"11" -> 3 times.
"111" -> 1 time.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "101"
Output: 2
Explanation: Substring "1" is shown 2 times in s.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "111111"
Output: 21
Explanation: Each substring contains only 1's characters.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
```

        //left ,right : The left & right side of the sliding window
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        while(right < n){
            if(s[right] == '1'){
                ans = (ans + (right - left + 1)) % mod;
            }
            else // Find character '0', need to move the left side to the next position
                left = right + 1;
            ++right;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
