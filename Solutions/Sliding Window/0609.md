# 6909. Longest Even Odd Subarray With Threshold


## Problem Description

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer threshold.

Find the length of the longest subarray of nums starting at index l and ending at index r (0 <= l <= r < nums.length) that satisfies the following conditions:

nums[l] % 2 == 0

For all indices i in the range [l, r - 1], nums[i] % 2 != nums[i + 1] % 2

For all indices i in the range [l, r], nums[i] <= threshold

Return an integer denoting the length of the longest such subarray.

Note: A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.



**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,5,4], threshold = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: In this example, we can select the subarray that starts at l = 1 and ends at r = 3 => [2,5,4]. This subarray satisfies the conditions.
Hence, the answer is the length of the subarray, 3. We can show that 3 is the maximum possible achievable length.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [1,2], threshold = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: In this example, we can select the subarray that starts at l = 1 and ends at r = 1 => [2]. 
It satisfies all the conditions and we can show that 1 is the maximum possible achievable length.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,4,5], threshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: In this example, we can select the subarray that starts at l = 0 and ends at r = 2 => [2,3,4]. 
It satisfies all the conditions.
Hence, the answer is the length of the subarray, 3. We can show that 3 is the maximum possible achievable length.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 100 
1 <= nums[i] <= 100 
1 <= threshold <= 100
```
