# 1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element/description)

## Problem Description

The frequency of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. In one operation, you can choose an index of nums and increment the element at that index by 1.

Return the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most k operations.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].
4 has a frequency of 3.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: There are multiple optimal solutions:
- Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [3,9,6], k = 2
Output: 1
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
1 <= k <= 10^5
```

class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequency(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int left = 0, right = 0, n = nums.size(), ans = 0;
        long sum = 0;
        for(right = 0; right < n; ++right){
            sum += nums[right];
            //sum + k : the maximum sum we can get from nums[left ... right]
            //nums[right]*(right - left + 1) : the sum of the number in the sliding window and all of numbers are changed to nums[right] 
            while((long)nums[right]*(right - left + 1) > sum + k){
                // means that it's impossible to make all numbers in the sliding window as the same number
                sum -= nums[left];
                ++left;
            }
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
