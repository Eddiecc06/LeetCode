# 1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element/description/

## Problem Description

Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: You must delete one element.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
```

class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0, right = 0, cnt = 1, longest = 0;
        for(right = 0; right < nums.size(); ++right){
            if(nums[right] == 0)
                --cnt;
            while(cnt < 0 ){ // meaning that there're more two 0 in the sliding window
                if(nums[left] == 0)
                    ++cnt;
                ++left; //move the left of sliding window until there's only one 0 in the sliding window
            }
            longest = max(longest, right - left);
        }
        return longest;
    }
};
```
