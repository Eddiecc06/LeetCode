# 1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/description/)

## Problem Description

There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for n minutes. Every minute, some number of customers enter the store. You are given an integer array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of the customer that enters the store at the start of the ith minute and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy. You are given a binary array grumpy where grumpy[i] is 1 if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the ith minute, and is 0 otherwise.

When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise, they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for minutes consecutive minutes, but can only use it once.

Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], minutes = 3
Output: 16
Explanation: The bookstore owner keeps themselves not grumpy for the last 3 minutes. 
The maximum number of customers that can be satisfied = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 16.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: customers = [1], grumpy = [0], minutes = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints**
```
n == customers.length == grumpy.length
1 <= minutes <= n <= 2 * 10^4
0 <= customers[i] <= 1000
grumpy[i] is either 0 or 1.
```

### _C++ Code_
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfied(vector<int>& customers, vector<int>& grumpy, int minutes) {
        //satisfied : Used to record the number of customers can be satisfied without bookstore owner secret technique 
        int satisfied = 0;
        int n = customers.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            if(grumpy[i] == 0) // The bookstore owner isn't grumpy
                satisfied += customers[i];
        }
        //Use a sliding window to find the maximum possible number of customers can be satisfied by using a secret technique. The length of sliding window is equal to "minutes"
        int i, NotSatisfied = 0, MaxPossible = 0;
        for(i = 0; i < minutes; ++i){
            if(grumpy[i] == 1) // The bookstore owner is grumpy
                NotSatisfied += customers[i];
        }
        //MaxPossible : The maximum number of customer can be satisfied by keeping not grumpy for "minutes" consecutive minutes
        //NotSatisfied : The number of customer can't be satisfied during  "minutes" consecutive minutes
        MaxPossible = NotSatisfied;
        for(i = minutes; i < n; ++i){
            if(grumpy[i-minutes] == 1) // The left side of sliding window is moved for one step. Need to check the previous one if can't be satisfied or not
                NotSatisfied -= customers[i-minutes];
            if(grumpy[i] == 1)
                NotSatisfied += customers[i];
            MaxPossible = max(MaxPossible, NotSatisfied);
        }
        return satisfied + MaxPossible;
    }
};
