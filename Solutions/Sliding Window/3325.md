# 3325. Count Substrings With K-Frequency Characters I
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-with-k-frequency-characters-i/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a string s and an integer k, return the total number of substrings of s where at least one character appears at least k times.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "abacb", k = 2

Output: 4

Explanation:

The valid substrings are:

"aba" (character 'a' appears 2 times).
"abac" (character 'a' appears 2 times).
"abacb" (character 'a' appears 2 times).
"bacb" (character 'b' appears 2 times).
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "abcde", k = 1

Output: 15

Explanation:

All substrings are valid because every character appears at least once.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 3000
1 <= k <= s.length
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
```
