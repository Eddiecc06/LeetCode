# 2090. K Radius Subarray Averages
https://leetcode.com/problems/k-radius-subarray-averages/description/

## Problem Description

You are given a 0-indexed array nums of n integers, and an integer k.

The k-radius average for a subarray of nums centered at some index i with the radius k is the average of all elements in nums between the indices i - k and i + k (inclusive). If there are less than k elements before or after the index i, then the k-radius average is -1.

Build and return an array avgs of length n where avgs[i] is the k-radius average for the subarray centered at index i.

The average of x elements is the sum of the x elements divided by x, using integer division. The integer division truncates toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.

For example, the average of four elements 2, 3, 1, and 5 is (2 + 3 + 1 + 5) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75, which truncates to 2.

```
Input: nums = [7,4,3,9,1,8,5,2,6], k = 3
Output: [-1,-1,-1,5,4,4,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation:
- avg[0], avg[1], and avg[2] are -1 because there are less than k elements before each index.
- The sum of the subarray centered at index 3 with radius 3 is: 7 + 4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 37.
  Using integer division, avg[3] = 37 / 7 = 5.
- For the subarray centered at index 4, avg[4] = (4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2) / 7 = 4.
- For the subarray centered at index 5, avg[5] = (3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 6) / 7 = 4.
- avg[6], avg[7], and avg[8] are -1 because there are less than k elements after each index.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [100000], k = 0
Output: [100000]
Explanation:
- The sum of the subarray centered at index 0 with radius 0 is: 100000.
  avg[0] = 100000 / 1 = 100000.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [8], k = 100000
Output: [-1]
Explanation: 
- avg[0] is -1 because there are less than k elements before and after index 0.
```

**Constraints**
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i], k <= 10^5
```

            sum += nums[i]; //push into the window
            if(i - len >= 0)
                sum -= nums[i-len]; // pop nums[i-len], if it's out of window
            if(i >= len - 1)
                ans[i - k] = sum / len; // the center of this window is at 'i-k'
        }
        return ans;
    }
