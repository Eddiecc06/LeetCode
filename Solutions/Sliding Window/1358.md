# 1358. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
```

**Constraints**
```
3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.
```

        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            MostRightIndex[s[i] - 'a'] = i;
            //Have visited all character 'a', 'b' and 'c'
            if(MostRightIndex[0] != -1 && MostRightIndex[1] != -1 && MostRightIndex[2] != -1)
               counts += (1 + min(MostRightIndex[0], min(MostRightIndex[1], MostRightIndex[2]) ) ); 
        }
        return counts;
    }
