# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/

## Problem Description

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”


**Example 1**:

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```
**Example 2**:

<img width="201" alt="截圖 2023-04-25 上午12 15 48" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18256877/234055895-c20895e9-7b9d-4a6d-8e60-c9b8209f3c8e.png">

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```

**Constraints**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the BST.
```

        TreeNode *ancestor;
        ancestor = root;
        while(ancestor){
            //Since it's BST, if current node larger than both q and p, q and p must bost be its left child nodes
            if(ancestor->val > p->val && ancestor->val > q->val)
                ancestor = ancestor->left;
            //Since it's BST, if current node small than both q and p, q and p must bost be its right child nodes
            else if(ancestor->val < p->val && ancestor->val < q->val)
                ancestor = ancestor->right;
            else
                return ancestor;
        }
        return ancestor;
    }
};
