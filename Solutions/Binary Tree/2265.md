# 2265. Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-nodes-equal-to-average-of-subtree/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the average of the values in its subtree.

Note:

  - The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.
  - A subtree of root is a tree consisting of root and all of its descendants.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: root = [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
For the node with value 4: The average of its subtree is (4 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 6) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4.
For the node with value 5: The average of its subtree is (5 + 6) / 2 = 11 / 2 = 5.
For the node with value 0: The average of its subtree is 0 / 1 = 0.
For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
For the node with value 6: The average of its subtree is 6 / 1 = 6.
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
```

**Constraints**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
0 <= Node.val <= 1000
```

        //The sum of left subtree + The sum of right subtree + the value of root
        sum = leftSum + rightSum + root->val;
        //The nubmer of nodes of left subtree + The nubmer of nodes of right subtree + 1 (root)
        count = leftCount + rightCount + 1;
        if(root->val == sum / count)
            ++ans;
        return {sum, count};
    }

### _Complexity Anlysis_
- _Time Complexity_: O(n) // n : the numbe of nodes
- _Space Complexity_：O(h)  // h : the height of tree
