# 2331. Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree
[Easy]()

## Problem Description

You are given the root of a full binary tree with the following properties:

  - Leaf nodes have either the value 0 or 1, where 0 represents False and 1 represents True.
  - Non-leaf nodes have either the value 2 or 3, where 2 represents the boolean OR and 3 represents the boolean AND.

The evaluation of a node is as follows:

  - If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the value of the node, i.e. True or False.
  - Otherwise, evaluate the node's two children and apply the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.

Return the boolean result of evaluating the root node.

A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children.

A leaf node is a node that has zero children.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: root = [2,1,3,null,null,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The above diagram illustrates the evaluation process.
The AND node evaluates to False AND True = False.
The OR node evaluates to True OR False = True.
The root node evaluates to True, so we return true.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: root = [0]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node is a leaf node and it evaluates to false, so we return false.
```

**Constraints**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
0 <= Node.val <= 3
Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
Leaf nodes have a value of 0 or 1.
Non-leaf nodes have a value of 2 or 3.
```
