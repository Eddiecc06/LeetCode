# 450. Delete Node in a BST
https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/

## Problem Description

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST.

Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

  1. Search for a node to remove.

  2. If the node is found, delete the node.



**Example 1**:

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
```
**Example 2**:

<img width="333" alt="截圖 2023-09-05 上午12 26 14" src="https://github.com/Eddiecc06/LeetCode/assets/18256877/4be26ac3-c84f-428e-9952-9d5ba105615b">

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```

**Constraints**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
Each node has a unique value.
root is a valid binary search tree.
-105 <= key <= 105 
```

Follow up: Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?

    if (root == nullptr)
      return nullptr;
    if(root->val > key) // The key is on the right subtree

    else if(root->val < key)  // The key is on the left subtree
      root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);

        return root->left;       
      TreeNode *minNode = root->right;
      //Find the new root node
      while(minNode->left)
        minNode = minNode->left;
      //Delete the node which is replaced to be the new root node
      root->val = minNode->val;
      root->right = deleteNode(root->right, minNode->val);
    }
    return root;
  }
};
