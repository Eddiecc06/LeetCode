# 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

**Example 1**:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
Output: [1,3,null,null,2]
```

```
Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
Output: [1]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.
```

**Constraints**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000].
1 <= Node.val, target <= 1000
```

### _C++ Code_
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target){
        if(!root)
            return nullptr;
        root->left = removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);
        root->right = removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);

        //delete the leaf nodes with value target
        if(!root->left && !root->right && root->val == target)
            return nullptr;
        return root;       
    }
};
```

### _Complexity Anlysis_
- _Time Complexity_: O(n) // n : The number of nodes
- _Space Complexity_：O(h) // h : The height of the tree
