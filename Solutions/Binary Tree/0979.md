# 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: root = [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: root = [0,3,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.
```

**Constraints**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is n.
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= Node.val <= n
The sum of all Node.val is n.
```

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:

    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        int moves = 0;
        DFS(root, moves);
        return moves;
    }
    int DFS(TreeNode *node, int &moves){
        if(node == nullptr)
            return 0;
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        if(node->left)
            left = DFS(node->left, moves);
        if(node->right)
            right = DFS(node->right, moves);
        moves += abs(left) + abs(right);
        //Need to decrease 1 since every node has exactly one coin.
        //-1 : means that current node needs to get '1' coin from other nodes.
        //1  : means that current node needs to move '1' coin to other nodes.
        return node->val + left + right - 1;
    }
};
```

### _Complexity Anlysis_
- _Time Complexity_: O(n) // n : The number of nodes
- _Space Complexity_：O(h) // h : The height of binary tree
