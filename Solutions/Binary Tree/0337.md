# 337. House Robber III
https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/description/

## Problem Description

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.

```
Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```

**Constraints**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
0 <= Node.val <= 10^4
```

class Solution {

public:
    int rob(TreeNode* root) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        return DFS(root, left, right);
    }
    int DFS(TreeNode* node, int& leftNode, int& rightNode){
        if(!node) 
            return 0;
        int leftNode_l = 0, leftNode_r = 0, rightNode_l = 0, rightNode_r = 0;
        leftNode = rob(node->left, leftNode_l, leftNode_r);
        rightNode = rob(node->right, rightNode_l, rightNode_r);
        return max(leftNode+rightNode, node->val + leftNode_l + leftNode_r + rightNode_l + rightNode_r);
    }
