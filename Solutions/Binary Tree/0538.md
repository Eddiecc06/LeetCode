# 538. Convert BST to Greater Tree
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

  - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
  - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
  - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Note: This question is the same as 1038: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/

```
Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: root = [0,null,1]
Output: [1,null,1]
```

**Constraints**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
All the values in the tree are unique.
root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
```
