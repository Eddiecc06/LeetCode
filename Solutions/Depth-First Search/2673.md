# 2673. Make Costs of Paths Equal in a Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/make-costs-of-paths-equal-in-a-binary-tree/description/

## Problem Description

You are given an integer n representing the number of nodes in a perfect binary tree consisting of nodes numbered from 1 to n. The root of the tree is node 1 and each node i in the tree has two children where the left child is the node 2 * i and the right child is 2 * i + 1.

Each node in the tree also has a cost represented by a given 0-indexed integer array cost of size n where cost[i] is the cost of node i + 1. You are allowed to increment the cost of any node by 1 any number of times.

Return the minimum number of increments you need to make the cost of paths from the root to each leaf node equal.

Note:

A perfect binary tree is a tree where each node, except the leaf nodes, has exactly 2 children.

The cost of a path is the sum of costs of nodes in the path.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: n = 7, cost = [1,5,2,2,3,3,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: We can do the following increments:
- Increase the cost of node 4 one time.
- Increase the cost of node 3 three times.
- Increase the cost of node 7 two times.
Each path from the root to a leaf will have a total cost of 9.
The total increments we did is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
It can be shown that this is the minimum answer we can achieve.
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: n = 3, cost = [5,3,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The two paths already have equal total costs, so no increments are needed.
```


**Constraints**
```
3 <= n <= 10^5
n + 1 is a power of 2
cost.length == n
1 <= cost[i] <= 10^4
```

public:
    int minIncrements(int n, vector<int>& cost) {
        int ans = 0;
        DFS(1, n, cost, ans);
        return ans;
    }
    int DFS(int curNode, const int n, vector<int> &cost, int &ans){
        if(curNode > n) //Exceed the range of Binary Tree
            return 0;
        int left, right;
        left = DFS(curNode*2, n, cost, ans);    //The sum of left path
        right = DFS(curNode*2+1, n, cost, ans); //The sum of right path
        
        //The difference between left child node and right child node
        ans += abs(left - right);
        //Return the cost of path to the child tree
        return cost[curNode - 1] + max(left, right);
    }
};
```
