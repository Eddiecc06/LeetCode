# 695. Max Area of Island
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints**
```
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
```

        //Change the visited element as 2 to mark it as a visited element
        grid[i][j] = 2;
        return 1 + DFS(grid, i+1, j) + DFS(grid, i, j+1) + DFS(grid, i-1, j) + DFS(grid, i, j-1);
    }
