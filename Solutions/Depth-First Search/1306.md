# 1306. Jump Game III

https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-iii/description/

## Problem Description

Given an array of non-negative integers arr, you are initially positioned at start index of the array. 

When you are at index i, you can jump to i + arr[i] or i - arr[i], check if you can reach to any index with value 0.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.




**Example 1**:
```
Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 
All possible ways to reach at index 3 with value 0 are: 
index 5 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 
index 5 -> index 6 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: arr = [3,0,2,1,2], start = 2
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to reach at index 1 with value 0.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 104
0 <= arr[i] < arr.length
0 <= start < arr.length
```

            return false;       // arr[start] < 0 means that the index "start" is viisted
        // since all elements in arr are positive, make it as negative value to indicate that this element is visited
        if(arr[start] == 0)
            return true;
        arr[start] *= -1;
        return canReach(arr, start + arr[start]) || canReach(arr, start - arr[start]);
    }
};
