# 135. Candy
https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/description/

## Problem Description

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.

Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```


**Constraints**
```
n == ratings.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4
```
