# 861. Score After Flipping Matrix
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.

A move consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all 0's to 1's, and all 1's to 0's).

Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possible score after making any number of moves (including zero moves).


**Example 1**:

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 39
Explanation: 0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: grid = [[0]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints**
```
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 20
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
```

        //The minimum highest score we can reach from a matrix m*n
        //All number in the first column is 1 and other numbers are 0. For example :
        // 1 0 0 0
        // 1 0 0 0
        // 1 0 0 0
        int maxScore =(1 << (n-1))*m;
        //Visit the 1-st column to (n-1)-th column
        for(int j = 1; j < n; ++j){
            //counts : The amount of number which has the same value as the first number in the same row.
            int counts = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i){
                if(grid[i][j] == grid[i][0])
                    ++counts;
            }
            //Find the way to make the as much as possible
            //Let there be as many numbers '1' as possible on the j-th column
            maxScore += max(counts, m - counts)*(1 << (n - 1 - j));
        }
        return maxScore;
    }
