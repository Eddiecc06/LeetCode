# 1727. Largest Submatrix With Rearrangements
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-submatrix-with-rearrangements/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a binary matrix matrix of size m x n, and you are allowed to rearrange the columns of the matrix in any order.

Return the area of the largest submatrix within matrix where every element of the submatrix is 1 after reordering the columns optimally.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 4.
```
**Example 2**:

<img width="408" alt="截圖 2023-11-26 下午11 49 52" src="https://github.com/Eddiecc06/LeetCode/assets/18256877/44c6df1c-540a-4605-ade2-3b1c42a10d6d">

```
Input: matrix = [[1,0,1,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 3.
```

**Example 3**:
```
Input: matrix = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Notice that you must rearrange entire columns, and there is no way to make a submatrix of 1s larger than an area of 2.
```

**Constraints**
```
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m * n <= 10^5
matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

```

                    ++height[j];
                else // If the matrix[i][j] = 0, set as 0 since we can't get a submatrix with all 1 elements 
                    height[j] = 0;    
            }
            //sort_height : Sort the vector "height" with increasing order
            vector<int> sort_height = height;
            sort(sort_height.begin(), sort_height.end());
            for(int k = 0; k < n; ++k){
                ans = max(ans, sort_height[k] * (n-k));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
