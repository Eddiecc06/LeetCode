# 1561. Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-coins-you-can-get/description/)

## Problem Description

There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:

  - In each step, you will choose any 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
  - Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
  - You will pick the next pile with the maximum number of coins.
  - Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
  - Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.

Given an array of integers piles where piles[i] is the number of coins in the ith pile.

Return the maximum number of coins that you can have.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
Output: 9
Explanation: Choose the triplet (2, 7, 8), Alice Pick the pile with 8 coins, you the pile with 7 coins and Bob the last one.
Choose the triplet (1, 2, 4), Alice Pick the pile with 4 coins, you the pile with 2 coins and Bob the last one.
The maximum number of coins which you can have are: 7 + 2 = 9.
On the other hand if we choose this arrangement (1, 2, 8), (2, 4, 7) you only get 2 + 4 = 6 coins which is not optimal.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: piles = [2,4,5]
Output: 4
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: piles = [9,8,7,6,5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 18
```

**Constraints**
```
3 <= piles.length <= 10^5
piles.length % 3 == 0
1 <= piles[i] <= 10^4
```

        for(int p : piles)
            ++freq[p];

        //choose = -1 : means that I picks the pile
        int i = maxpile, choose = 1;
        while(pickTimes > 0){
            if(freq[i] > 0){
                if(choose == 1) // Alice is picking the pile with the maximum number of coins
                    choose *= -1;
                else{   // I'm picking the pile with the maximum number of coins
                    --pickTimes;
                    choose *= -1;
                    maxNumCoins += i;
