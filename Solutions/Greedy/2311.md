# 2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.

Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.

Note:

  - The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
  - The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
  - A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "1001010", k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is "00010", as this number is equal to 2 in decimal.
Note that "00100" and "00101" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.
The length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "00101001", k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: "000001" is the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 1, as this number is equal to 1 in decimal.
The length of this subsequence is 6, so 6 is returned.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
1 <= k <= 109
```

class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(string s, int k) {
        //ones : The number of '0' in the string 's'
        //ones : The number of '0' in the longest Subsequence
        int n = s.size(), zeros = 0, ones = 0;
        long long curValue = 0, pow = 1;

        for(char c : s)
            if(c == '0')
                ++zeros;
        //Greedy. The
        for(int i = n-1; i >= 0; --i){
            if(s[i] == '1'){
                curValue += pow;
                ++ones;
            }
            pow <<= 1;
            if(curValue + pow > k || pow > k)
                break;
        }

        return zeros + ones;
    }
