# 1975. Maximum Matrix Sum
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matrix-sum/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:

  - Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.

Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.

Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can follow the following steps to reach sum equals 4:
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first row by -1.
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first column by -1.
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3],[1,2,3]]
Output: 16
Explanation: We can follow the following step to reach sum equals 16:
- Multiply the 2 last elements in the second row by -1.
```

**Constraints**
```
n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
2 <= n <= 250
-10^5 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5
```

            }
        }
        if(negativeNumCounts % 2 == 0) //We can change all negative numbers to be positive numbers
            return sum;
        //Decreas the number with minimum absolute value
        return sum - minNum*2;
    }
};
