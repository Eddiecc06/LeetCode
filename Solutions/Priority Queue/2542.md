# 2542. Maximum Subsequence Score
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subsequence-score/description/

## Problem Description

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length n and a positive integer k. 

You must choose a subsequence of indices from nums1 of length k.

For chosen indices i0, i1, ..., ik - 1, your score is defined as:

The sum of the selected elements from nums1 multiplied with the minimum of the selected elements from nums2.

It can defined simply as: (nums1[i0] + nums1[i1] +...+ nums1[ik - 1]) * min(nums2[i0] , nums2[i1], ... ,nums2[ik - 1]).

Return the maximum possible score.

A subsequence of indices of an array is a set that can be derived from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} by deleting some or no elements.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,3,3,2], nums2 = [2,1,3,4], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The four possible subsequence scores are:
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 2 with score = (1+3+3) * min(2,1,3) = 7.
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,1,4) = 6. 
- We choose the indices 0, 2, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,3,4) = 12. 
- We choose the indices 1, 2, and 3 with score = (3+3+2) * min(1,3,4) = 8.
Therefore, we return the max score, which is 12.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums1 = [4,2,3,1,1], nums2 = [7,5,10,9,6], k = 1
Output: 30
Explanation: 
Choosing index 2 is optimal: nums1[2] * nums2[2] = 3 * 10 = 30 is the maximum possible score.
```

**Constraints**
```
n == nums1.length == nums2.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^5
1 <= k <= n
```

        long long ans = 0;
        long long sum = 0;

        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<>> pq;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); ++i)
            score.push_back({nums2[i], nums1[i]});
        //Since we must multiply with the minimum of the selected elements from nums2.
        //sort vector according to the value of nums2 with descreasing order
        sort(score.begin(), score.end(), greater<>());

        for(int i = 0; i < score.size(); ++i){
            pq.push(score[i].second);
            sum += score[i].second;
            //if we add more than k number, remove the smallest number and add the new one
            //To check if we can get a larger score
            if(pq.size() > k){
                sum -= pq.top();
                pq.pop();
            }
            //Since the vector "score" has been sorted in decreasing order, it's guaranteed that the current visited pair is the minimum of the selected elements
            if(pq.size() == k)
                ans = max(ans, sum*score[i].first);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
