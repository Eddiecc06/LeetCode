# 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.

You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. You can only attend one event at any time d.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
Output: 4
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= events.length <= 10^5
events[i].length == 2
1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^5
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
        int counts = 0, day = 1;
        int n = events.size(), index = 0;
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());
        priority_queue<int,vector<int>, greater<int>>pq;

        while(!pq.empty() || index < n){
            //Find all available days
            while(index < n && events[index][0] == day){
                pq.push(events[index][1]);
                ++index;
            }
            //Pick the first day whch is ended earliest
            if(!pq.empty()){
                pq.pop();
                ++counts;
            }
            // Remove the event which has been ended
            while(!pq.empty() && pq.top() <= day)
                pq.pop();
            ++day;
        }
        return counts;
    }
};
```

### _Complexity Anlysis_
- _Time Complexity_: O(d + nlogn) // d : The days. n : The number of events
- _Space Complexity_：O(n)
