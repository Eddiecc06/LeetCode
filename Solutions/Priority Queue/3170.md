# 3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars
[Medium]()

## Problem Description

You are given a string s. It may contain any number of '*' characters. Your task is to remove all '*' characters.

While there is a '*', do the following operation:

  - Delete the leftmost '*' and the smallest non-'*' character to its left. If there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.
Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all '*' characters.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "aaba*"

Output: "aab"

Explanation:

We should delete one of the 'a' characters with '*'. If we choose s[3], s becomes the lexicographically smallest.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "abc"

Output: "abc"

Explanation:

There is no '*' in the string.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s consists only of lowercase English letters and '*'.
The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all '*' characters.
```

            if(s[i] == '*'){ 
                //Find the lowest letter in the string before '*'
                for(int j = 0; j < 26; ++j){
                    if(LetterPosition[j].size() > 0){
                        //Replace it as the '*'. The character marked at this position is to be deleted
                        s[LetterPosition[j].back()] = '*';
                        LetterPosition[j].pop_back(); //Remove it from the recording
                        break;

                }
            }
            else
                LetterPosition[s[i] - 'a'].push_back(i);
        }
        //Reconstruct the answer string
        string ans = "";
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            if(s[i] != '*')
                ans += s[i];
        }
        return ans;
