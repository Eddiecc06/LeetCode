# 392. Is Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/

## Problem Description

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

**Constraints**
```
0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 10^4
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
```
