# 3403. Find the Lexicographically Largest String From the Box I
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-lexicographically-largest-string-from-the-box-i/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a string word, and an integer numFriends.

Alice is organizing a game for her numFriends friends. There are multiple rounds in the game, where in each round:

  - word is split into numFriends non-empty strings, such that no previous round has had the exact same split.
  - All the split words are put into a box.

Find the lexicographically largest string from the box after all the rounds are finished.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: word = "dbca", numFriends = 2
Output: "dbc"
Explanation: 
All possible splits are:
"d" and "bca".
"db" and "ca".
"dbc" and "a".
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: word = "gggg", numFriends = 4

Output: "g"

Explanation: 

The only possible split is: "g", "g", "g", and "g".
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= word.length <= 5 * 10^3
word consists only of lowercase English letters.
1 <= numFriends <= word.length
```

    string answerString(string word, int numFriends) {
        if (numFriends == 1)
            return word;
        //lastStr : Find the last Substring in Lexicographical Order
        string lastStr = lastSubstring(word);
        int n = word.size(), m = lastStr.size();
        return last.substr(0, min(m, n - numFriends + 1));
