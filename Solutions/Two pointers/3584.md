# 3584. Maximum Product of First and Last Elements of a Subsequence
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-first-and-last-elements-of-a-subsequence/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array nums and an integer m.

Return the maximum product of the first and last elements of any subsequence of nums of size m.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: nums = [-1,-9,2,3,-2,-3,1], m = 1

Output: 81

Explanation:

The subsequence [-9] has the largest product of the first and last elements: -9 * -9 = 81. Therefore, the answer is 81.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,-5,5,6,-4], m = 3

Output: 20

Explanation:

The subsequence [-5, 6, -4] has the largest product of the first and last elements.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [2,-1,2,-6,5,2,-5,7], m = 2

Output: 35

Explanation:

The subsequence [5, 7] has the largest product of the first and last elements.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
1 <= m <= nums.length
```

        int n = nums.size();
        long long ans = LLONG_MIN;
        if(m == 1){// The edge case
            for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
                ans = max(ans, (long long)nums[i] * nums[i]);

        }

        long long maxNum = nums[0], minNum = nums[0];
        for(int i = m - 1; i < n; ++i){
            maxNum = max(maxNum, (long long)nums[i - m + 1]);
            minNum = min(minNum, (long long)nums[i - m + 1]);
            //product1 : The product of nums[i] * maxNum
            //product2 : The product of nums[i] * minNum
            long long product1, product2;
            product1 = (long long)nums[i]*maxNum;
            product2 = (long long)nums[i] * minNum;
            ans = max(ans, max(product1, product2));
        }

        return ans;
