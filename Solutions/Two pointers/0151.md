# 151. Reverse Words in a String
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/

## Problem Description

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.




**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^4
s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
There is at least one word in s.
```

class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        string ans;
        int right = s.size(), left;
        for(left = s.size()-1; left >= 0; --left){
            if(s[left] == ' ')
                right = left;
            else if(left == 0 || s[left-1] == ' '){
                //If it's not the first visted string, adding " " before adding the new string
                if(ans.size() > 0)
                    ans += " ";
                ans += s.substr(left, right - left);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
