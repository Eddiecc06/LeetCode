# 3622. Check Divisibility by Digit Sum and Product
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-divisibility-by-digit-sum-and-product/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a positive integer n. Determine whether n is divisible by the sum of the following two values:

  - The digit sum of n (the sum of its digits).

  - The digit product of n (the product of its digits).

Return true if n is divisible by this sum; otherwise, return false.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 99

Output: true

Explanation:

Since 99 is divisible by the sum (9 + 9 = 18) plus product (9 * 9 = 81) of its digits (total 99), the output is true.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 23

Output: false

Explanation:

Since 23 is not divisible by the sum (2 + 3 = 5) plus product (2 * 3 = 6) of its digits (total 11), the output is false.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 10^6
```
