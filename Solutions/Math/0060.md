# 60. Permutation Sequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/description/

## Problem Description

The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

"123"

"132"

"213"

"231"

"312"

"321"

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.




**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 9
1 <= k <= n!
```
