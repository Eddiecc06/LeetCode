# 598. Range Addition II
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition-ii/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an m x n matrix M initialized with all 0's and an array of operations ops, where ops[i] = [ai, bi] means M[x][y] should be incremented by one for all 0 <= x < ai and 0 <= y < bi.

Count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3]]
Output: 4
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = []
Output: 9
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= m, n <= 4 * 10^4
0 <= ops.length <= 10^4
ops[i].length == 2
1 <= ai <= m
1 <= bi <= n
```

### _C++ Code_
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCount(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& ops) {
        int minm = m, minn = n;
        for(int i = 0; i < ops.size(); ++i){
            minm = min(minm, ops[i][0]);
            minn = min(minn, ops[i][1]);
        }
        return minm*minn;
    }
};
```

### _Complexity Anlysis_
- _Time Complexity_: O(n)   // n : the size of ops
- _Space Complexity_：O(1)
