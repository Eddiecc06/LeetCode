# 3099. Harshad Number
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/harshad-number/)

## Problem Description

An integer divisible by the sum of its digits is said to be a Harshad number. You are given an integer x. Return the sum of the digits of x if x is a Harshad number, otherwise, return -1.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: x = 18
Output: 9
Explanation:
The sum of digits of x is 9. 18 is divisible by 9. So 18 is a Harshad number and the answer is 9.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: x = 23
Output: -1
Explanation:
The sum of digits of x is 5. 23 is not divisible by 5. So 23 is not a Harshad number and the answer is -1.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= x <= 100
```
