# 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-integer-divisible-by-k/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
```
**Example 3**:
```
Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= k <= 10^5
```

        if(k % 2 == 0 || k % 5 == 0)
            return -1;
        
        int remainder = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= k; ++i){
            remainder = (remainder* 10 + 1) % k;
            if(remainder == 0) // It is divisible by k
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
