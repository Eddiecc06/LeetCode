# 441. Arranging Coins
https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/description/

## Problem Description

You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. 

The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
```
