# 3102. Minimize Manhattan Distances
[Hard](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-manhattan-distances/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given a 0-indexed array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].

The distance between two points is defined as their Manhattan distance.

Return the minimum possible value for maximum distance between any two points by removing exactly one point.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: points = [[3,10],[5,15],[10,2],[4,4]]
Output: 12
Explanation: The maximum distance after removing each point is the following:
- After removing the 0th point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (10, 2), which is |5 - 10| + |15 - 2| = 18.
- After removing the 1st point the maximum distance is between points (3, 10) and (10, 2), which is |3 - 10| + |10 - 2| = 15.
- After removing the 2nd point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (4, 4), which is |5 - 4| + |15 - 4| = 12.
- After removing the 3rd point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (10, 2), which is |5 - 10| + |15 - 2| = 18.
It can be seen that 12 is the minimum possible maximum distance between any two points after removing exactly one point.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: points = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: It can be seen that removing any of the points results in the maximum distance between any two points of 0.
```

**Constraints**
```
3 <= points.length <= 10^5
points[i].length == 2
1 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^8
```
