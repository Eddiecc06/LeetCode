# 2849. Determine if a Cell Is Reachable at a Given Time
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-a-cell-is-reachable-at-a-given-time/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given four integers sx, sy, fx, fy, and a non-negative integer t.

In an infinite 2D grid, you start at the cell (sx, sy). Each second, you must move to any of its adjacent cells.

Return true if you can reach cell (fx, fy) after exactly t seconds, or false otherwise.

A cell's adjacent cells are the 8 cells around it that share at least one corner with it. You can visit the same cell several times.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: sx = 2, sy = 4, fx = 7, fy = 7, t = 6
Output: true
Explanation: Starting at cell (2, 4), we can reach cell (7, 7) in exactly 6 seconds by going through the cells depicted in the picture above. 
```
**Example 2**:

<img width="386" alt="截圖 2024-02-10 下午7 38 42" src="https://github.com/Eddiecc06/LeetCode/assets/18256877/9c71828d-7476-43ab-94cd-17251241dcdd">

```
Input: sx = 3, sy = 1, fx = 7, fy = 3, t = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Starting at cell (3, 1), it takes at least 4 seconds to reach cell (7, 3) by going through the cells depicted in the picture above. Hence, we cannot reach cell (7, 3) at the third second.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= sx, sy, fx, fy <= 10^9
0 <= t <= 10^9
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isReachableAtTime(int sx, int sy, int fx, int fy, int t) {
        //handling the condition that the start point and the final point are the same
        if(sx == fx && sy == fy)
            return (t == 0 || t > 1);
        //diffx : The difference of x coordinate between the starting point and the final point
        //diffy : The difference of y coordinate between the starting point and the final point
        int diffx = abs(fx - sx), diffy = abs(fy - sy);
        int minsteps = 0;
        if(diffx > diffy)
            minsteps = diffx;
        else
            minsteps = diffy;
        return minsteps <= t;
    }
};
