# 2761. Prime Pairs With Target Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-pairs-with-target-sum/

## Problem Description

You are given an integer n. We say that two integers x and y form a prime number pair if:

1 <= x <= y <= n

x + y == n

x and y are prime numbers

Return the 2D sorted list of prime number pairs [xi, yi]. The list should be sorted in increasing order of xi. If there are no prime number pairs at all, return an empty array.

Note: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 with only two factors, itself and 1.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 10
Output: [[3,7],[5,5]]
Explanation: In this example, there are two prime pairs that satisfy the criteria. 
These pairs are [3,7] and [5,5], and we return them in the sorted order as described in the problem statement.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: []
Explanation: We can show that there is no prime number pair that gives a sum of 2, so we return an empty array. 
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 10^6
```
