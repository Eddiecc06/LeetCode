# 2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.

You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.

Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.

```
Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: 43
Explanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [2,4,5,3,1].
- The road (0,1) has an importance of 2 + 4 = 6.
- The road (1,2) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.
- The road (2,3) has an importance of 5 + 3 = 8.
- The road (0,2) has an importance of 2 + 5 = 7.
- The road (1,3) has an importance of 4 + 3 = 7.
- The road (2,4) has an importance of 5 + 1 = 6.
The total importance of all roads is 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 43.
It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 43.

```
Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: 20
Explanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [4,3,2,5,1].
- The road (0,3) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.
- The road (2,4) has an importance of 2 + 1 = 3.
- The road (1,3) has an importance of 3 + 5 = 8.
The total importance of all roads is 9 + 3 + 8 = 20.
It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 20.
```

**Constraints**
```
2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
1 <= roads.length <= 5 * 10^4
roads[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
ai != bi
There are no duplicate roads.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumImportance(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
        //degree[i] : The degree of city 'i'. The degree means that current city 'i' is connected to how many cities 
        vector<int> degree(n, 0);

        for(auto &road : roads){
            ++degree[road[0]];
            ++degree[road[1]];
        }
    
        vector<int> cities(n);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            cities[i] = i;
        //Sort the cities by degree. The city with the largest degree is put in the front of array
        sort(cities.begin(), cities.end(), [&](int m, int n){
            return degree[m] > degree[n];
        });
        //The city with larger degree will be assigned with a larger number
        long long maxImportance = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            maxImportance += ( (long long)(n-i)*(degree[cities[i]]) );
        return maxImportance;
    }
};
```

### _Complexity Anlysis_
- _Time Complexity_: O(O(n log n + m)) // m : The number of roads. n : The number of cities
- _Space Complexity_：O(n)
