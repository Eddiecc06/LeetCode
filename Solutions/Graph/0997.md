# 997. Find the Town Judge

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/description/

## Problem Description

In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.

Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.

There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.



**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
```
**Constraints**

    1 <= n <= 1000
    0 <= trust.length <= 104
    trust[i].length == 2
    All the pairs of trust are unique.
    ai != bi
    1 <= ai, bi <= n
