# 3243. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries I
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-after-road-addition-queries-i/description/)

## Problem Description

You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array queries.

There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. Initially, there is a unidirectional road from city i to city i + 1 for all 0 <= i < n - 1.

queries[i] = [ui, vi] represents the addition of a new unidirectional road from city ui to city vi. After each query, you need to find the length of the shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1.

Return an array answer where for each i in the range [0, queries.length - 1], answer[i] is the length of the shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1 after processing the first i + 1 queries.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 5, queries = [[2,4],[0,2],[0,4]]
Output: [3,2,1]

```
After the addition of the road from 2 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 3.

```
After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 2.

```
After the addition of the road from 0 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 1.
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 4, queries = [[0,3],[0,2]]
Output: [1,1]

```
After the addition of the road from 0 to 3, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 3 is 1.

```
After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path remains 1.
```

**Constraints**
```
3 <= n <= 500
1 <= queries.length <= 500
queries[i].length == 2
0 <= queries[i][0] < queries[i][1] < n
1 < queries[i][1] - queries[i][0]
There are no repeated roads among the queries.
```

        //NewDistance : The new distance between city 'cur' and city 'n-1'
        int NewDistance = distance[cur] + 1;
        //Check each source city of 'cur' city. Update the distance if we found that current distance can be shorter than the previous recorded one
        for(int source : graph[cur]){
            if(distance[source] > NewDistance){
                distance[source] = NewDistance;
                UpdateDistance(source, distance, graph);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### _Complexity Anlysis_
- _Time Complexity_: O(q(n+q)) // n : The number of cities, q : the number of queries
- _Space Complexity_：O(n+q)
