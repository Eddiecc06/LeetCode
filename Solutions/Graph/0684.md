# 684. Redundant Connection
[Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/description/)

## Problem Description

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
```

**Constraints**
```
n == edges.length
3 <= n <= 1000
edges[i].length == 2
1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
ai != bi
There are no repeated edges.
The given graph is connected.
```

            while(parents[nodeB] != 0)
                nodeB = parents[nodeB];
            //It means that the parent node of node 'a' and node 'b' is the same. The current edge is redundant
            if(nodeA == nodeB)
                return edge;
