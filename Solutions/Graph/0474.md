# 474. Ones and Zeroes
https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/description/

## Problem Description

You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.

Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are at most m 0's and n 1's in the subset.

A set x is a subset of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
{"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.
```

**Constraints**
```
1 <= strs.length <= 600
1 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists only of digits '0' and '1'.
1 <= m, n <= 100
```

                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - numZeros][j - numOnes] + 1);
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
