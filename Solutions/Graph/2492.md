# 2492. Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-of-a-path-between-two-cities/description/

## Problem Description

You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1 to n. 

You are also given a 2D array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi with a distance equal to distancei. 

The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.

Return the minimum possible score of a path between cities 1 and n.

Note:

A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.

It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities 1 and n multiple times along the path.

The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between 1 and n.



**Example 1**:

```
Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
It can be shown that no other path has less score.
```

**Example 2**:

<img width="195" alt="截圖 2023-03-23 上午12 35 28" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18256877/226974703-418e078a-b4ba-4ab8-9719-714d13f14d79.png">

```
Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.
```

**Constraints**
```
2 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= roads.length <= 10^5
roads[i].length == 3
1 <= ai, bi <= n
ai != bi
1 <= distancei <= 10^4
There are no repeated edges.
There is at least one path between 1 and n.

```

                //check the graph. If the path hasn't been visited, push the city to queue

                    mini_Score = min(mini_Score, path.second);
