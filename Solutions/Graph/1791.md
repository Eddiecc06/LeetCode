# 1791. Find Center of Star Graph
[Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/description/)

## Problem Description

There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.


**Example 1**:

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints**
```
3 <= n <= 10^5
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
1 <= ui, vi <= n
ui != vi
The given edges represent a valid star graph.
```

    int findCenter(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        //The center node must appear in each array edges[i]
        if(edges[0][0] == edges[1][0] || edges[0][0] == edges[1][1])
            return edges[0][0];
        return edges[0][1];
