# 207. Course Schedule
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/

## Problem Description

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. 

You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```


**Constraints**
```
1 <= numCourses <= 2000
0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.
```

      queue<int> q;
      int i, n = prerequisites.size();

        graph[prerequisites[i][1]].push_back(prerequisites[i][0]);
        // the number of pre-courses need to be taken before starting the course prerequisites[i][0]
        ++numPrecourse[prerequisites[i][0]];
      }
      //Start to take the course which no need any pre-course
      for(i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i){
        if(numPrecourse[i] == 0)
          q.push(i);
      }

      while(!q.empty()){
        int curCourse = q.front();
        q.pop();
        for(i = 0; i < graph[curCourse].size(); ++i){
          --numPrecourse[graph[curCourse][i]];
          //If we've taken all pre-courses, we can take this course in the next round.
          if(numPrecourse[graph[curCourse][i]] == 0)
            q.push(graph[curCourse][i]);
        }
      }
      for(i = 0; i < numCourses; i++)
        if(numPrecourse[i] != 0) // It means that course[i] can't be taken
          return false;
        return true;
    }
};
