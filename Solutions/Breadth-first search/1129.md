# 1129. Shortest Path with Alternating Colors 
https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-with-alternating-colors/description/

## Problem Description

You are given an integer n, the number of nodes in a directed graph where the nodes are labeled from 0 to n - 1. 

Each edge is red or blue in this graph, and there could be self-edges and parallel edges.

You are given two arrays redEdges and blueEdges where:

redEdges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a directed red edge from node ai to node bi in the graph, and

blueEdges[j] = [uj, vj] indicates that there is a directed blue edge from node uj to node vj in the graph.

Return an array answer of length n, where each answer[x] is the length of the shortest path from node 0 to node x such that the edge colors alternate along the path, or -1 if such a path does not exist.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: n = 3, redEdges = [[0,1],[1,2]], blueEdges = []
Output: [0,1,-1]
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: n = 3, redEdges = [[0,1]], blueEdges = [[2,1]]
Output: [0,1,-1]
```


**Constraints**
```
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= redEdges.length, blueEdges.length <= 400
redEdges[i].length == blueEdges[j].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi, uj, vj < n
```

            //If we haven't recorded the distance of current node, update it.
            if(distance[curNode[0]] == -1)
                distance[curNode[0]] = curNode[1];
            for(auto &adj : graph[curNode[0]]){
                //the node with different color edge and hasn't been visited
                if(curNode[2] != adj.second && adj.first != -1){
                    q.push({adj.first, curNode[1]+1, adj.second});
                    //the node has been visited, set it as -1
                    adj.first = -1;
                }
            }
        }
        return distance;
