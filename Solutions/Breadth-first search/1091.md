# 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix
https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/description/

## Problem Description

Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return -1.

A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., (0, 0)) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., (n - 1, n - 1)) such that:

All the visited cells of the path are 0.

All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).

The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.

```
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2
```
**Example 2**:

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: 4
```

**Constraints**
```
n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
```
