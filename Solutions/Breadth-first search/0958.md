# 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/description/

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. 

It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.



**Example 1**:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
```
**Example 2**:

<img width="199" alt="截圖 2023-03-15 下午10 39 18" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18256877/225343939-1103bdb4-0bb7-4860-b035-e293253672c9.png">

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
```


**Constraints**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000
```

                //If current node only has left subtree or doesn't have left and right subtree, meaning that it's a second last level. checkLastLevl = TRUE
