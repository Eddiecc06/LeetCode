# 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes
https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-visiting-all-nodes/description/

## Problem Description

You have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.

You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge.

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node.

You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.

```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]
```
**Example 2**:

<img width="360" alt="截圖 2023-09-18 上午12 26 37" src="https://github.com/Eddiecc06/LeetCode/assets/18256877/fd255c05-8865-450a-bf4b-33331bd6b583">

```
Input: graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
```

**Constraints**
```
n == graph.length
1 <= n <= 12
0 <= graph[i].length < n
graph[i] does not contain i.
If graph[a] contains b, then graph[b] contains a.
The input graph is always connected.
```
