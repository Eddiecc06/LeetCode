# 1162. As Far from Land as Possible 
https://leetcode.com/problems/as-far-from-land-as-possible/description/

## Problem Description

Given an n x n grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. 

If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.


**Example 1**:
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.
```
**Example 2**:
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.
```


**Constraints**
```
n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
```

## Solution-2
## How to process the gird
    First, we find all land elements and put into the queue.
    Then, we process every elements from the land's neighboring elements.
    Everytime we process a water element, we'll replace the value from 0 to the "distance to land -1".
    As we finish processing all elements, we can get the largest distance.
    For example :
